    "abstract": "Ionic transport in conventional ionic solids is generally considered to proceed via independent diffusion events or ``hops.'' This assumption leads to well-known Arrhenius expressions for transport coefficients, and is equivalent to assuming diffusion is a Poisson process. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the low-temperature $B1$, $B3$, and $B4$ AgI polymorphs, we have compared rates of ion hopping with corresponding Poisson distributions to test the assumption of independent hopping in these common structure types. In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed. In low temperature $B3$ and $B4$, diffusion is characterized by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops. Diffusion coefficients cannot be expressed in a simple Arrhenius form dependent on single-ion free energies, and intrinsic diffusion must be considered a many-body process.",

    "abstract": "This study shows that DNA (linearized plasmid, 4331 base pairs and salmon sperm, 2000 base pairs, respectively) adsorbs to model membranes of zwitterionic liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers in solutions containing divalent Ca2+ cations, and also in solutions containing monovalent Na+. The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles. In the presence of Ca2+, DNA induces the formation of multilamellar vesicles in which DNA intercalates the lamellae. Possible electrostatic and hydrophobic mechanisms for the adsorption of DNA in solutions containing monovalent salt are discussed and compared to the observations in divalent salt.",

In order to improve the catalytic process, a composite film electrode is developed based on (i) carbon microparticles of 2\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm diameter to enhance charge transport and (ii) a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (here PIM-EA-TB with a BET surface area of 1027\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121). The latter acts as a highly rigid molecular framework for the embedded free radical catalyst with simultaneous access to aqueous phase and substrate. The resulting mechanism for the oxidation of primary alcohols is shown to switch in reaction order from first to zeroth with increasing substrate concentration consistent with a kinetically limited process with competing diffusion of charge at the polymer layer-electrode interface (here the \u201cLEk\u201d case in Albery-Hillman notation). Reactivity optimisation and screening for a wider range of primary alcohols in conjunction with DFT-based relative reactivity correlation reveals substrate hydrophobicity as an important factor for enhancing catalytic currents. The PIM-EA-TB host matrix is proposed to control substrate partitioning and thereby catalyst reactivity and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 353\u00a0K and utilizes an unusual promiscuous nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway to metabolize both glucose and galactose. It has been proposed that a part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway occurs in parallel in S. solfataricus, in which the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) is promiscuous for both glucose and galactose metabolism. Recombinant S. solfataricus KDGK protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in 0.1\u00a0M sodium acetate pH 4.1 and 1.4\u00a0M NaCl. The crystal structure of apo S. solfataricus KDGK was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 and a ternary complex with 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDGlu) and an ATP analogue was resolved at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5. The complex suggests that the structural basis for the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate KDGlu and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal) is derived from a subtle repositioning of residues that are conserved in homologous nonpromiscuous kinases.",

    "abstract": "We have applied DFT and molecular modeling to investigate the interaction between carbon-based nanoparticles (CNPs) and geosorbents using the adsorption of buckminsterfullerene (C60) on pyrophyllite and comparing it to the aggregation of C60 molecules. The approach is transferable and can be readily applied to more complex CNP\u2013clay systems. We predict that C60 molecules adsorb preferably on the mineral surface and that the most stable adsorption site is the ditrigonal cavity of the surface. The free energy of adsorption on pyrophyllite was calculated to be more favorable than aggregation both in a vacuum (\u22120.47 vs \u22120.41 eV) and in water (\u22120.25 vs \u22120.19 eV). In aqueous environments, there are energy barriers as the C60 molecule approaches either a surface or another C60 molecule, and these occur upon disruption of the hydration layers that surround each component. There are also free energy minima that correspond to outer-sphere and more favorable inner-sphere complexes. We expect this adsorptive behavior to be a general feature of CNP\u2013clay systems, and as clays are ubiquitous in the environment, it will offer an inexpensive remediative method to prevent the widespread impact of molecular C60 and CNPs.",

The band alignment and band-gap deformation potentials were analyzed, showing an increase in the valence band maximum from Mg to Zn to Cd. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B1 structure is stable over all (Mg,Cd)O compositions, as expected from the preferences of the binary oxides. The (Mg,Zn)O alloy undergoes a tetrahedral to octahedral transition above 34% Mg content, in agreement with experiment. For (Zn,Cd)O, a transition is predicted above 62% Cd content.

    "abstract": "\r\n                        Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate the interlayer structure of water saturated organoclays. The basal spacing values of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA) intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mont) in dry and water saturated states were detected using XRD. Then the results were compared with simulation results of dry CTMA-Mont. The MD simulations show that the CTMA cations form layer structures on siloxane surface and aggregate in the interlayer space. Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules. Although water molecules within interlayer space can form strong H-bonds as in bulk water the number of H-bond for each water molecule is reduced. Our results indicate that MD simulations represent a useful tool for exploring the microstructure of water saturated organoclays.\r\n                    ",

    "abstract": "The standard model of enhanced ionic conductivities in solid electrolyte heterostructures follows from a continuum mean-field description of defect distributions that makes no reference to crystalline structure. To examine ionic transport and defect distributions while explicitly accounting for ion-ion correlations and lattice effects, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic defects, with a difference in standard chemical potentials of mobile fluoride ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces. Non-charge-neutral ``space-charge'' regions, however, extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong lattice-mediated defect-defect interactions. We identify an atomic-scale ``Frenkel polarization'' mechanism for the interfacial enhancement in ionic mobility, where preferentially oriented associated Frenkel pairs form at the interface and promote local ion mobility via concerted diffusion processes.",

Synthetically useful yields, regioselectivities, and functional group tolerance were found for methylene oxidation of substrates bearing a phenyl, ketone, ester, or sulfonate group. Oxidation of the natural products (\u2212)-ambroxide and sclareolide proceeded selectively, and retention of configuration was seen in cis-decalin hydroxylation. At 60 \u00b0C, even primary C\u2013H bonds can be activated: whereas methane was overoxidized to CO2 in 39% yield without giving partially oxidized products, ethane was transformed into acetic acid in 25% yield based on total NaIO4. 18O labeling was demonstrated in cis-decalin hydroxylation with 18OH2 and NaIO4. A kinetic isotope effect of 3.0 \u00b1 0.1 was found in cyclohexane oxidation at 23 \u00b0C, suggesting C\u2013H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. Competition experiments between C\u2013H and water oxidation show that C\u2013H oxidation of sodium 4-ethylbenzene sulfonate is favored by 4 orders of magnitude.

This raises questions regarding the nature of the barriers that are holding back progress and whether current research is adequately addressing the key issues that are currently limiting device performance.

This concept is based on the generalization that a majority of pathogenic bacteria secrete virulence factors such as toxins and lipases that actively damage cell membranes, typically observed as tissue damage around infected wounds, while nonpathogenic bacteria do not (or not at high concentration). The eventual aim of this work is to produce responsive dressings which release antimicrobials and change color only on infected wounds.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "We have synthesized three new carbazole-based fluorescent boronic acid sensors to investigate the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the novel d-PET effect, in which the fluorophore acts as the electron donor and the protonated amine/boronic acid group as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (PET). Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed. Herein we propose that the orientation of the electron donor/acceptor may significantly affect the fluorescence modulation efficiency of the PET effect; this discovery will be important for the future design of PET sensors with improved fluorescence transduction efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP with high \u00ce\u00b2-PP content was prepared by a novel supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent, which was prepared with pimelic acid supported on nano-CaCO3 as support. The influences of the content of the support and supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent, pre-melting temperature (Tmelt) and scan rates on crystallization behavior and melting characteristics, and the \u00ce\u00b2-PP content of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD). The results indicated that the addition of supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent markedly increased the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Increasing the content of supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent slightly increased the Tc, but had no influence on the melting temperatures (Tm) of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP. The Tc and Tm of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP decreased slightly with increasing the content of the support nano-CaCO3. The effects of scan rates and multiple scans with different Tmelt on the crystallization and melting behavior of PP nucleated by supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent are similar to that of PP nucleated by calcium pimelate (CaHA). The \u00ce\u00b2-PP content above 90 percent was obtained in PP nucleated by supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent and was not influenced by the content of nano-CaCO3. The supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent prepared by supporting pimelic acid on nano-CaCO3 is a \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent with high efficiency and selectivity, and low cost.",

    "abstract": " We have synthesized three new phenylethynylated carbazole boronic acid sensors, which were predicted to display novel d-PeT fluorescence transduction (PeT, photoinduced electron transfer; fluorophore as the electron donor of the electron transfer, ET) by DFT/TDDFT calculations. The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.",

    "abstract": "The covalent boron\u2013diol interaction enables elaborate design of boronic acid-based saccharide sensors. Over the last decade, this research topic has been well developed thanks to the integration of boronic acid chemistry with a range of techniques, including supramolecular chemistry, materials chemistry, surface modification, and nanotechnology. New sensing strategies and platforms have been introduced and remarkable progress has been achieved to fully utilize the unique property of boron\u2013diol interaction and to improve the binding affinity towards different targets, especially under physiological conditions. In this review, the latest progress over the past 30 months (from late 2012 to early 2015) is highlighted and discussed to shed light on this versatile and promising platform for saccharide sensing.",

    "abstract": "Mineral oil microdroplets containing the model antioxidant N,N-didodecyl-N\u2032,N\u2032-diethyl-phenylene-diamine (DDPD) are immobilized into a 100\u00d7100 pore-array (ca. 10\u2005\u03bcm individual pore diameter, 100\u2005\u03bcm pitch) in a boron-doped diamond electrode surface. The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions. An extraction mechanism and the formation of a separate organic product phase are proposed to explain this behavior.",

    "abstract": "The ternary semiconductors ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}\\text{Sn}{X}_{3}$ ($X=\\text{S}$, Se) are found frequently as secondary phases in synthesized ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{ZnSnS}}_{4}$ and ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{ZnSnSe}}_{4}$ samples, but previous reports on their crystal structures and electronic band gaps are conflicting. Here we report their structural and electronic properties as calculated using a first-principles approach. We find that (i) the diverse range of crystal structures such as the monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal phases can all be derived from the zinc-blende structure with tetrahedral coordination. (ii) The energy stability of different structures is determined primarily by the local cation coordination around anions, which can be explained by a generalized valence octet rule. Structures with only Cu${}_{3}$Sn and Cu${}_{2}$Sn${}_{2}$ clusters around the anions have low and nearly degenerate energies, which makes Cu and Sn partially disordered in the cation sublattice. (iii) The direct band gaps of the low-energy compounds ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{SnS}}_{3}$ and ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{SnSe}}_{3}$ should be in the range of 0.8\\char21{}0.9 and 0.4 eV, respectively, and are weakly dependent on the long-range structural order.

It is also thought that Zn3N2 can be used as a starting material to achieve p-type conductivity in ZnO-based oxide homojunctions. In this work, the electronic structure of bulk Zn3N2 is studied using density-functional theory (DFT) with different approximations to the exchange-correlation functional, ranging from (semi-)local functionals to the quasiparticle G0W0 approach. We predict a bandgap in the range of 0.9\u20131.2 eV, reconciling the scattered values reported in experiments, and a remarkably low work function (ionisation potential) of 4.2 eV for the (111) surface.\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called \u201cDNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors\u201d, DDIAS). In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively. A double stranded DNA intercalator with a ferrocenyl (Fc) redox marker was synthesized to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that the \u2018in-solution\u2019 method offers a favourable medium (in a homogeneous solution) for the binding between the aptamer and PSA, which shows to be more efficient than the \u2018on-chip\u2019 approach. DDIAS shows promising analytical performance under optimized conditions, with a limit of detection in the range of fM and low non-specific adsorption.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": " Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a p-type semiconductor used in thin-film solar cells. To achieve high light-to-electricity conversion, annealing in the presence of CdCl2 is essential, but the underlying mechanism is still under debate. Recent evidence suggests that a reduction in the high density of stacking faults in the CdTe grains is a key process that occurs during the chemical treatment. A range of stacking faults, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and twin boundary, are computationally investigated to identify the extended defects that limit performance. The low-energy faults are found to be electrically benign, while a number of higher energy faults, consistent with atomic-resolution micrographs, are predicted to be hole traps with fluctuations in the local electrostatic potential. It is expected that stacking faults will also be important for other thin-film photovoltaic technologies.",

Nonisothermal crystallization behavior and melting characteristics of \u03b2-nucleated iPP and its blends were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter and wide angle X-ray diffraction. Experimental results indicated that the crystallization temperature (T) of PP shifts to high temperature in the non-nucleated PP/PA66 blends because of the \u03b1-nucleating effect of PA66. T of PP and the \u03b2-crystal content (K\u03b2) in \u03b2-nucleated iPP/PA66 blends not only depended on the PA66 content, but also on the compatibilizer type.

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized on gold electrodes with 6-mecarpto-hexanol to control the surface density of the ssDNA probe, and hybridized with complementary DNA. The binding of the Fc intercalator to dsDNA was measured by differential pulse voltammetry. This new biosensor was optimized to allow the detection of single base pair mismatched sequences, able to detect as low as 10 pM target ssDNA with a dynamic range from 10 pM to 100 nM. DNA extracted from wastewater was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting human-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The aim of this approach is to enable the analysis of population biomarkers in wastewater for the evaluation of public health using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The E-DNA biosensor was employed to detect human-specific mtDNA from wastewater before and after PCR amplification. The results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting human DNA biomarkers in wastewater using the developed biosensor, which may allow the further development of DNA population biomarkers for public health using WBE.",

Effects of PA6 on the non-isothermal crystallization behavior, melting characteristics and the \u00ce\u00b2-PP content of alloys were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results indicated that the crystallization temperature (Tcp) of PP shifts to high temperature in the non-nucleated PP/PA6 alloys due to the \u00ce\u00b1-nucleating effect of PA6.

    "abstract": "Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles are commonly used as drug carriers in controlled drug release and targeting. To achieve predictable and clinically relevant volumes of drug distribution, nanoparticle size, surface charge, and especially composition and structure must be controlled. Understanding the internal structures within the particles is fundamentally important to explain differences in drug loading and variations in drug release rate. We prepared nanoparticles from ester-terminated PLGA-PEG polymers via nanoprecipitation, and studied the effects of altering the solvent\u2013water miscibility (THF, acetone, and acetonitrile). Morphology, size, polydispersity, and \u03b6-potential of PLGA-PEG nanoparticles were characterized. Small angle neutron scattering measurements and fitted models revealed the internal nanoparticle structure: PLGA blocks of 7\u20139 nm are encapsulated inside a fairly dense PEG/water network in a fractal geometry. Particles with a larger PLGA block volume and higher PEG volume fraction in the particle interior result in greater retention of the hydrophilic anticancer drug carboplatin.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein chips have demonstrated to be a sensitive and low cost solution to identify and detect tumor markers. However, efficient multiparametric analysis remains a challenge due to protein variability. Crucial parameters are the design of stable and reproducible surfaces which maintain biological activity of immobilized proteins, and immobilization conditions (buffer, pH, concentration). We have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions was evaluated on the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that each antibody displays variable biological activities depending on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Under optimized conditions, we can reach a limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10 pM. Our microstructured chip offers the possibility to implement a customized multiplex immunoassay combining optimal immobilization condition for each antibody on the same chip.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThere is an urgent need to identify relevant tumor markers showing high sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer, were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies. Results indicated that the detection level of each anti-TAA autoantibody in a given serum sample was strongly dependant on the surface chemistry. Combining five TAAs (p53, Hsp60, Hsp70, Her2-Fc, NY-ESO-1) on two different surface chemistries (NHS and APDMES) allowed the significant detection of more than 82% breast cancer sera.",

To some extent, variation in the particle size and vesicle cavity diameter can be achieved by adjusting the anionic\u2013nonionic surfactant molar ratio. An onion-like vesicle morphology was obtained by changing the inorganic salt concentration. Based on the fitting of small angle neutron scattering data, a formation mechanism has been proposed.

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that robust mesostructured films will grow at the surface of alkaline solutions containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyethylenimine (PEI), and silica precursors. Here we have used time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering to investigate the structural evolution of the micellar solution from which the films form, at several different CTAB\u2013PEI concentrations. Simple models have been employed to quantify the size and shape of the micelles in the solution. There are no mesostructured particles occurring in the CTAB\u2013PEI solution prior to silica addition; however, after the addition of silicate species the hydrolysis and condensation of these species causes the formation of mesophase particles in a very short time, much faster than ordering observed in the film at the interface. The mesophase within the CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica particles finally rearranges into a 2D hexagonal ordered structure. With the aid of the previous neutron reflectivity data on films formed at the air/water interface from similar solutions, a formation mechanism for CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica films at the air/water interface has been developed. We suggest that although the route of mesostructure evolution of the film is the same as that of the particles in the solution, the liquid crystalline phase at the interface is not directly formed by the particles that developed below the interface.",

    "abstract": "The electronic structure and phase stability of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe were examined in the zinc-blende (B3), wurtzite (B4), and NiAs-type (B8) crystal structures using a first-principles method. Both the band-gap and valence-band maximum (VBM) deformation potentials of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe in the B3 structure were analyzed, revealing a less negative band-gap deformation potential from ZnTe to MgTe to CdTe, with a VBM deformation potential increase from CdTe to ZnTe to MgTe. The natural band offsets were calculated taking into account the core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd)Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe. However, the (Mg,Zn)Te alloy undergoes a B3 to B4 transition above 88% Mg concentration and a B4 to B8 transition above 95% Mg concentration. For (Mg,Cd)Te, a B3 to B4 transition is predicted above 80% Mg content and a B4 to B8 transition above 90% Mg concentration. Using the calculated band-gap bowing parameters, the B3 (Mg,Zn)Te [(Mg,Cd)Te] alloys are predicted to have accessible direct band gaps in the range 2.39(1.48)\\char21{}3.25(3.02) eV, suitable for photovoltaic absorbers.",

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements show that dried films maintain the same ordered mesostructure as the films at the air/water interface, and here the effects of PEI concentration and cross-linker (CL) on film mesostructure were investigated. Free-standing silica films were then synthesized by adding tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) to the surfactant\u2212polyelectrolyte solutions. Silica films have been studied by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and neutron reflectivity on as-synthesized films at the solution surface.

Optimization of surface chemistry and spotting conditions are crucial parameters to enhance antibodies\u2019 immobilization efficiency and to maintain their biological activity. Here, we report the implementation of an antibody microarray for the detection of tumor markers involved in colorectal cancer. Three-dimensional microstructured glass slides were functionalized with three different aminated molecules ((3-aminopropyl)dimethylethoxysilane (APDMES), Jeffamine, and chitosan) varying in their chain length, their amine density, and their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. The physicochemical properties of the resulting surfaces were characterized. Antibody immobilization efficiency through physical interaction was studied as a function of surface properties as well as a function of the immobilization conditions. The results show that surface energy, steric hindrance, and pH of spotting buffer have great effects on protein immobilization. Under optimal conditions, biological activities of four immobilized antitumor marker antibodies were evaluated in multiplex immunoassay for the detection of the corresponding tumor markers. Results indicated that the chitosan functionalized surface displayed the highest binding capacity and allowed to retain maximal biological activity of the four tested antibody/antigen systems. Thus, we successfully demonstrated the application of amino-based surface modification for antibody microarrays to efficiently detect tumor markers.",

The increased binding ability of the asymmetric bidentate receptor of ortho-boronic acid and imidazolium towards F\u2013 enables it to sense fluoride ions in a 95:5 CH3CN/HEPES aqueous solution.

Film formation processes were probed by time-resolved neutron reflectivity measurements.

On the basis of GID results, a phase diagram for the catanionic surfactant/polyelectrolyte/TMOS film system was drawn. These films can be easily removed from the interface and mesoporous silica films which retain the film geometry can be obtained after calcination; moreover, this film preparation method provides a simple way to impart polymer functionality into the mesostructured silica wall, which means these films have potential applications in a variety of fields such as catalysis, molecular separation, and drug delivery.",

Highly ordered anatase 2D-hexagonal mesoporous titania (meso-TiO2) nanoparticles with a high surface area and large pore size were fabricated. Meso-TiO2 was used as scattering particles and mixed with titania nanocrystallites at weight proportions ranging from 0 to 100%. Films made from the composites were used as scattering layers in DSSCs. The influence of meso-TiO2 proportion on the structure, morphology, and optical properties of the films were investigated. The results show that the films became more porous, with a larger surface roughness, and had higher surface areas and greater light-scattering effects when meso-TiO2 was incorporated. The performance of these scattering layers in relatively large, 1 cm2 area, DSSCs was studied to link cell performance to the detailed physical properties of the meso-TiO2/nanoparticle films. The optimum composition of scattering layers was obtained by mixing 50 wt % meso-TiO2 with titania nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein chips have demonstrated to be a sensitive and low cost solution to identify and detect tumor markers. However, efficient multiparametric analysis remains a challenge due to protein variability. Crucial parameters are the design of stable and reproducible surfaces which maintain biological activity of immobilized proteins. These parameters relate to surface chemistry and to immobilization conditions (printing buffers, washing etc.). In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that the biological activities of the immobilized antibodies were dependent on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Optimal immobilization conditions were different for each antibody. Limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10\u00a0pM can reach under optimized conditions. Our 3D microstructured chip offers the possibility to implement a customized multiplex immunoassay combining optimal immobilization condition for each antibody-antigen system on the same chip.",

The calcined films contain an anatase crystal phase and have a high surface area with a structure composed of one-dimensional long nanowires and mesoporous nanoparticle branches.

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift. Monitoring the morphological variations of single GNRs enables us to track the transverse etching of GNRs at arbitrary time. This promises to be a useful method for the study of different nanomaterials and their spectral properties.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractA nano-composite of negatively charged carbon nanoparticles (Emperor 2000\u2122), chitosan, and nano-palladium is produced in a one-step hydrothermal process with oxalate reductant. In voltammetric measurements strong pH effects on capacitance and Faradaic current responses are observed due to chitosan forming a shell (or \u201chydrothermal wrapping\u201d) around both carbon nanoparticles and palladium particles in the water-based hydrothermal process. In spite of the wrapping, some Pd-catalytic processes are observed, but with pH controlling the rate. The shell around Pd nanoparticles appears to only allow small molecule reactants such as H2 and O2 but not formic acid or methanol to reach the active catalyst surface. Membrane-transport limited and reaction-type limited catalytic electrochemical responses are observed with high selectivity. Implications of small molecule selectivity and mechanistic selectivity in suppressing cross-over losses in fuel cell technology are discussed.",

In conventional electrochemical systems this process is conducted in aqueous phase and the resulting formation of poorly soluble CO2 gas can limit the kinetics. Here, an alternative electrochemical system with the gas phase in closer contact to the palladium nanoparticle catalyst is investigated based on a glassy carbon electrode and a solid salt electrolyte. It is demonstrated that the reaction zone of salt (here (NH4)2SO4 is most effective), palladium nanoparticle catalyst, and gas phase, is where the electrochemical oxidation process occurs. The effects of the type of salt, the partial pressure of formic acid, and the gas flow rate are investigated. Preliminary data for the oxidation of hydrogen gas at the salt|palladium|electrode contact are reported. A significant salt effect on the palladium catalysed reactions is observed and potential future applications of \u201csalt cells\u201d in sensing are discussed.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "A modular approach was proposed for the preparation of chiral fluorescent molecular sensors, in which the fluorophore, scaffold, and chirogenic center can be connected by ethynyl groups, and these modules can easily be changed to other structures to optimize the molecular sensing performance of the sensors. This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis. The boronic acid sensors were used for selective and sensitive recognition of disaccharides and glycosylated steroids (ginsenosides).",

Boronic acids follow lectin functions not just in being able to bind saccharides, but in multivalent saccharide binding that enhances both affinity and selectivity. For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures. In this review, we discuss supramolecular selective sensing of saccharides by using simple boronic acids in their aggregate forms, after a brief survey of the general aspects of boronic acid-based saccharide sensing.\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": " The objective was to determine the disposition of polymer nanoparticles and an associated, lipophilic, model \u201cactive\u201d component on and within the skin following topical application. Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles containing covalently bound fluorescein methacrylate and dispersed Nile Red were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The two fluorophores differentiate the fate of the polymeric vehicle on and within the skin from that of the active. Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed using dermatomed porcine skin. Post-treatment with nanoparticle formulations, the skin surface was either cleaned carefully with buffer or simply dried with tissue, and then immediately visualized by confocal microscopy. Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter. At the skin surface, Nile Red remained partly associated with nanoparticles, but was also released to some extent and penetrated into deeper layers of the stratum corneum (SC). In summary, polymeric nanoparticles did not penetrate beyond the superficial SC, showed some affinity for hair follicles, and released an associated \u201cactive\u201d into the skin.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); topical drug delivery",

    "abstract": "We have prepared chiral fluorescent bisboronic acid sensors with 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-9H-carbazole as the fluorophore. The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.",

    "abstract": "In vivo monitoring of the biodistribution and activation of prodrugs is urgently required. Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.",

    "abstract": " The skin disposition of topically applied nanoparticles with varying degrees of hydrophobicity, composed of different proportions of polystyrene (PS) and poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA), and of an associated, model \u201cactive\u201d (Nile Red), was investigated. PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping",

Seven \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylates tested showed strong induced Cotton effects in the perylene absorption region around \u03bb=500\u2005nm, which were utilized for enantiomeric excess determination and chemo-discrimination of the analytes, with an average absolute error of 2\u2009% in ee determination and 100\u2009% correctness in analyte classification. Responses in the absorption spectra, which arise from the guest-enhanced aggregation, allow the determination of the sample concentration, thus enabling analysis of samples of unknown concentration and ee.

Single-crystal X-ray studies show that there is a significant reduction in the intertrimer Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au distances both with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. In the four complexes, the reduction in temperature from 293 to 100\u2005K is accompanied by a reduction in the shortest intermolecular Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au contacts of between 0.04 and 0.08\u2005\u00c5. The solid-state luminescent emission spectra of 1 and 2 display a red shift with decreasing temperature or increasing pressure. Compound 3 does not emit under ambient conditions but displays increasingly red-shifted luminescence upon cooling or compression. Compound 4 remains emissionless, consistent with the absence of intermolecular Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au interactions. The largest pressure induced shift in emission is observed in 2 with a red shift of approximately 630\u2005cm\u22121 per GPa between ambient and 3.80\u2005GPa. The shifts in all the complexes can be correlated with changes in Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au distance observed by diffraction.",

    "abstract": "Polyanionic phosphates have the potential to act as low-cost cathodes and stable framework materials for Na ion batteries. The mixed phosphates Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) are a fascinating new class of materials recently reported to be attractive Na ion cathodes which display low-volume changes upon cycling, indicative of long-lifetime operation. Key issues surrounding intrinsic defects, Na ion migration mechanisms, and voltage trends have been investigated through a combination of atomistic energy minimization, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory simulations. For all compositions, the most energetically favorable defect is calculated to be the Na/M antisite pair. MD simulations suggest Na+ diffusion extends across a 3D network of migration pathways with an activation barrier of 0.20\u20130.24 eV, and diffusion coefficients (DNa) of 10\u201310\u201310\u201311 cm2 s\u20131 at 325 K, suggesting good rate capability. The voltage trends indicate that doping the Fe-based cathode with Ni can significantly increase the voltage, and hence the energy density.",

For 1, there is a smooth reduction in unit-cell volume of ~20% from ambient pressure to 4.45 GPa, followed by a dramatic reduction in volume that coincides with a 7.7% increase in the b axis length. Above the pressure of 5.38 GPa a smooth volume reduction continues. In contrast, for 2, there is a continuous change in unit-cell volume with an observed space group change from C2/c to P21/c, between the pressures of 4.15 and 5.70 GPa. In the crystals of 1 between 4.45 and 5.38 GPa adjacent molecules slide over each other and the dominant stacking interaction changes from a thiophene\u22efthiophene interaction at 4.45 GPa to a benzothiophene\u22efbenzothiophene interaction at 5.38 GPa and, within each molecule, the benzothiophene groups show a significant reorientation at the phase transition. In 2 there is a loss of molecular symmetry, concomitant with the change in space group, at the phase transition with the asymmetric unit changing from containing half a unique molecule to two independent molecules. The molecules show significant reorientations of their ring systems. The nature of the observed transition in 1 was investigated using solid-state computational methods to prove the superior thermodynamic stability of the high-pressure phase to the lower pressure phase at pressures above 5.38 GPa. Solid state UV-Vis spectroscopy of 1, over the pressure range from ambient to 15.4 GPa showed that the compound displayed piezochromism with a significant red shift in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* absorption band and a colour change in the crystal from colourless to red with increasing pressure.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "Concurrent inhibition of aromatase and steroid sulfatase (STS) may provide a more effective treatment for hormone-dependent breast cancer than monotherapy against individual enzymes, and several dual aromatase\u2013sulfatase inhibitors (DASIs) have been reported. Three aromatase inhibitors with sub-nanomolar potency, better than the benchmark agent letrozole, were designed. To further explore the DASI concept, a new series of letrozole-derived sulfamates and a vorozole-based sulfamate were designed and biologically evaluated in JEG-3 cells to reveal structure\u2013activity relationships. Amongst achiral and racemic compounds, 2-bromo-4-(2-(4-cyanophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethyl)phenyl sulfamate is the most potent DASI (aromatase: IC50=0.87\u2005nM; STS: IC50=593\u2005nM). The enantiomers of the phenolic precursor to this compound were separated by chiral HPLC and their absolute configuration determined by X-ray crystallography. Following conversion to their corresponding sulfamates, the S-(+)-enantiomer was found to inhibit aromatase and sulfatase most potently (aromatase: IC50=0.52\u2005nM; STS: IC50=280\u2005nM). The docking of each enantiomer and other ligands into the aromatase and sulfatase active sites was also investigated.",

Co-crystallisation is commonly used to alter the structure of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) without affecting its activity. A comprehensive co-crystal screen of four fenamic acid derivatives affords a strictly limited number of co-crystals. These show no evidence of polymorphism, although some of the parent APIs exhibit significant polymorphism. Two of these co-crystals, of mefenamic acid and tolfenamic acid with 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, were previously unknown and are studied using X-ray diffraction. Co-crystals from this screen are fully characterised and display comparable solubility and stability with respect to the parent APIs; no phase transformations have been identified. A range of crystallisation techniques, including cooling and grinding methods, are shown to afford single polymorphic forms for each of the co-crystals.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

The size of its aliphatic ring was expanded; its sulfamate group was N,N-dimethylated, relocated to another position and flanked by an adjacent methoxy group; and series of quinolin-2(1H)-one and quinoline derivatives of Irosustat were explored. The STS inhibitory activities of the synthesised compounds were assessed in a preparation of JEG-3 cells. Stepwise enlargement of the aliphatic ring from 7 to 11 members increases potency, although a further increase in ring size is detrimental. The best STS inhibitors in\u2005vitro had IC50 values between 0.015 and 0.025\u2005nM. Other modifications made to Irosustat were found to either abolish or significantly weaken its activity. An azomethine adduct of Irosustat with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was isolated, and crystal structures of Irosustat and this adduct were determined. Docking studies were conducted to explore the potential interactions between compounds and the active site of STS, and suggest a sulfamoyl group transfer to formylglycine\u200575 during the inactivation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The isotopic sensitivity (CH3+ vs CD3+) of the equilibrium between the methyl cation in vacuum and in solution has been investigated. Two alternative options for describing the shape of the solute cavity within the widely used polarized continuum model for implicit solvation were compared; the UFF and UA0 methods give equilibrium isotope effects (EIEs) that vary as a function of the dielectric constant in opposite directions. The same isotope effect was also obtained as the average over 40 structures from a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulation for the methyl cation explicitly solvated by many water molecules; the inverse value of the EIE agrees with UFF but not UA0. The opposing trends may be satisfactorily explained in terms of the different degrees of exposure of the atomic charges to the dielectric continuum in cavities of different shapes.",

The complex is electrochemically stable and strongly absorbing with a molar extinction coefficient at \u03bb(max) = 564 nm of 11700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 (in MeOH). Experimental and computational data indicate that the HOMO, LUMO and electronic excited state energy levels are appropriate for functionality in a DSSC. From cyclic voltammetry the HOMO is estimated to be \u22125.27 eV, as supported by computational work, which locates the HOMO at \u22125.78 eV. From electrochemical, absorption and emission experiments, the MLCT energy levels are expected to be appropriate for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Our computations support this and locate the key MLCT transition at 563 nm. Despite this, the efficiency in DSSCs is extremely low (<0.1%) suggesting that the dye does not inject excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": " In this paper the immobilization of small unilamellar DMPC/GM1 lipid vesicles containing a water-soluble bodipy dye is described. The binding of the complete \u03b1\u03b2 toxin expressed by Vibrio cholerae to the attached vesicles was measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and a value of the dissociation constant Kd obtained. Further measurements showed that the interaction of both the \u03b1\u03b2-toxin and the \u03b2-subunit alone resulted in the permeation of the lipid membrane, with release of a fluorophore contained within the vesicle being measured by combined SPR and Surface Plasmon enhanced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SPFS). The leakage of dye through the membrane, measured by following the change in fluorescence, was fitted to a simple diffusion model. Finally, SPFS measurements of the effect of europium(III) chloride (EuCl3) showed that cholera toxin binding and subsequent membrane permeation could be blocked by 1 \u00b5mol dm\u22123 europium chloride. In view of the low oral toxicity of europium chloride, we speculate on the potential pharmaceutical applications of this molecule in the treatment of cholera infection.",

    "abstract": "The wide availability of alcohols makes them useful building blocks in synthesis. It is generally necessary to activate the alcohol in order to facilitate nucleophilic substitution reactions for the construction of new CC or CN bonds. The activation of alcohols by the temporary removal of hydrogen has attracted a lot of attention from many research groups. Although the reactions showed considerable scope, substrates that act as good ligands for the catalyst tend to need higher catalyst loadings and temperatures in order to be successful. In general, relatively high temperatures and catalyst loading are required even for simple substrates. The identification of simple, cheap catalysts capable of achieving these reactions under milder conditions, ideally room temperature, remains a goal for using alcohols as alkylating agents.",

    "abstract": "Isotopic partition-function ratios and kinetic isotope effects for reaction of S-adenosylmethionine with catecholate in water are evaluated using a subset of 324 atoms within its surrounding aqueous environment at the AM1/TIP3P level. Two alternative methods for treating motion in the six librational degrees of freedom of the subset atoms relative to their environment are compared. A series of successively smaller subset Hessians are generated by cumulative deletion of rows and columns from the initial 972 \u00d7 972 Hessian. We find that it is better to treat these librations as vibrations than as translations and rotations and that there is no need to invoke the Teller\u2013Redlich product rule. The validity of \u201ccut-off\u201d procedures for computation of isotope effects with truncated atomic subsets is assessed: to ensure errors in ln(KIE) < 1% (or 2% for the quantum-corrected KIE) for all isotopic substitutions considered, it is necessary to use a less-restrictive procedure than is suggested by the familiar two-bond cutoff rule.",

    "abstract": "Appreciation for the contribution of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) to chemical reactivity predates transition-state theory (TST). Quantum corrections to rate constants for the reactions catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and the same reactions in water are estimated by Bell's one-dimensional approximate method and give tunnelling contributions to catalysis of 1.6 and 0.95, respectively. Published results for NQEs, including both tunnelling and zero-point energies, estimated by the quantum classical path method for LDH, carbonic anhydrase, glyoxylase I and lipoxygenase, together with the corresponding reactions in water, are reviewed: the respective contributions to catalysis are 0.66, 5, 1 and 1. In the absence of better evidence that an enzymic rate enhancement is due to a significantly larger quantum correction for the enzyme-catalysed reaction than for an appropriate uncatalysed reference reaction, it is suggested that the term \u2018quantum catalysis\u2019 should be used with caution and restraint.

Products have been structurally characterised using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Reaction in fluoride-rich conditions produces chain, layer and three dimensional framework structures containing new and unusual structural features based on the linking of PO3F, PO2(OH,F)2 and Cu(O,F)n polyhedra (n = 4\u20136). Analysis of these structures, in terms of the copper coordination environments and their linkage dimensionalities, shows that these features are dependent on fluoride-content of the reaction medium and, therefore, the level of fluoride ion incorporation into the product materials. Structures exhibiting inter-layer spaces and channels frequently have these lined by terminal fluoride anions of the PO3F, PO2(OH,F)2 and Cu(O,F)n polyhedra.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "A powder neutron diffraction study of ussingite, Na2AlSi3O8(OH), over the temperature range 4\u2013850\u00a0K has been undertaken. The strong hydrogen bond that exists in this mineral has been accurately determined with the O\u2013H distance at 1.070(8)\u00a0\u00c5 and an O(donor)\u2013O(acceptor) separation of 2.481(5)\u00a0\u00c5 at 4\u00a0K, The distribution of hydrogen along the O\u2013O direction remains asymmetric between 4 and 850\u00a0K with the H atom being fully ordered at a single site, rather than partially disordered over two sites of a double-potential well, as in serandite. A gradual increase in the bonded O\u2013H distance at higher temperatures is observed, indicative of a broadening of the potential well in which the hydrogen atom is sited. Below 50\u00a0K, the material shows negative thermal expansion, likely to be associated with reduced bending motion of the O\u2013H bond.",

The molecular structure of the complexes bis-copper(I)(methoxy-N,N\u2032-di-isopropylureate) (1) and bis-copper(I)(methoxy-N,N\u2032-di-cyclohexylureate)(5) are described, as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes highlighted complex 1 as a possible copper CVD precursor. Low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LP-CVD) was employed using precursor 1, to synthesise thin films of metallic copper on ruthenium substrates under an atmosphere of hydrogen (H2). Analysis of the thin films deposited at substrate temperatures of 225 \u00b0C, 250 \u00b0C and 300 \u00b0C, respectively, by SEM and AFM reveal the films to be continuous and pin hole free, and show the presence of temperature dependent growth features on the surface of the thin films. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) all show the films to be high purity metallic copper.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

The molecular structures of several cyclopentadienylcopper(I) isocyanide complexes have been unambiguously determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes highlighted the isopropyl isocyanide complex [(\u03b75-C5H5)Cu(CNiPr)] (2a) and the tert-butyl isocyanide complex [(\u03b75-C5H5)Cu(CNtBu)] (2b) as possible copper metal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) precursors. Further modification of the precursors with variation of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligand system (varying between H, Me, Et, and iPr) has allowed the affect that these changes would have on features such as stability, volatility, and decomposition to be investigated. As part of this study, the vapor pressures of the complexes 2b, [(\u03b75-MeC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (3b), [(\u03b75-EtC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (4b), and [(\u03b75-iPrC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (5b) over a 40\u201365 \u00b0C temperature range have been determined. Low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD) was employed using precursors 2a and 2b to synthesize thin films of metallic copper on silicon, gold, and platinum substrates under a H2 atmosphere. Analysis of the thin films deposited onto both silicon and gold substrates at substrate temperatures of 180 and 300 \u00b0C by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy reveals temperature-dependent growth features: Films grown at 300 \u00b0C are continuous and pinhole-free, whereas films grown at 180 \u00b0C consist of highly crystalline nanoparticles. In contrast, deposition onto platinum substrates at 180 \u00b0C shows a high degree of surface coverage with the formation of high-density, continuous, and pinhole-free thin films. Powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) both show the films to be high-purity metallic copper.",

    "abstract": "A series of multinuclear Copper(I) guanidinate complexes have been synthesized in a succession of reactions between CuCl and the lithium guanidinate systems Li{L} (L = Me2NC(iPrN)2 (1a), Me2NC(CyN)2 (1b), Me2NC(tBuN)2(1c), and Me2NC(DipN)2 (2d) (iPr = iso-propyl, Cy = cyclohexyl, tBu = tert-butyl, and Dip = 2,6-disopropylphenyl) made in situ, and structurally characterized. The di-copper guanidinates systems with the general formula [Cu2{L}2] (L = {Me2NC(iPrN)2} (2a), {Me2NC(CyN)2} (2b), and {Me2NC(DipN)2} (2d) differed significantly from related amidinate complexes because of a large torsion of the dimer ring, which in turn is a result of transannular repulsion between adjacent guanidinate substituents. Attempts to synthesis the tert-butyl derivative [Cu2{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2] result in the separate formation and isolation of the tri-copper complexes [Cu3{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2(\u03bc-NMe2)] (3c) and [Cu3{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2(\u03bc-Cl)] (4c), both of which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Closer inspection of the solution state behavior of the lithium salt 1c reveals a previously unobserved equilibrium between 1c and its starting materials, LiNMe2 and N,N\u2032-di-tert-butyl-carbodiimide, for which activation enthalpy and entropy values of \u0394H\u29e7 = 48.2 \u00b1 18 kJ mol\u20131 and \u0394S\u29e7 = 70.6 \u00b1 6 J/K mol have been calculated using 1D-EXSY NMR spectroscopy to establish temperature dependent rates of exchange between the species in solution. The molecular structures of the lithium complexes 1c and 1d have also been determined and shown to form tetrameric and dimeric complexes respectively held together by Li\u2013N and agostic Li\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013C interactions. The thermal chemistry of the copper complexes have also been assessed by thermogravimetric analysis.",

The structures of these materials are formed from BO4 (BO3F) and As(O,OH)4 tetrahedra defining channels and interlayer regions containing either simple alkali metal cations or both cations and halide anions. These boroarsenate-based frameworks are unusual in comparison with other oxotetrahedral-based materials in that terminal OH, on As, may be present, decorating the inner surfaces of the channels, as in the 12-membered rings of K2[B(AsO3O)2H]. This unit also permits coordination to nonframework anions as well as cations, so that (Cs2[BAsO3OH]8[AsO4]2[CsCl4]Cl)2 (and its Br analogue) contains layers of [CsCl4]3- and Cl- ions separated and coordinated by the protonated boroarsenate framework.

The PEIS results were analysed using a phenomenological approach since the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction is not known a priori. The results indicate that the photocurrent onset potential is strongly affected by Fermi level pinning since the rate constant for surface recombination is almost constant in this potential region. The phenomenological rate constant for electron transfer was found to increase with potential, suggesting that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process. The PEIS analysis also shows that the limiting factor determining the performance of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 photoanode is electron\u2013hole recombination in the bulk of the oxide.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Polylactides with narrow polydispersities (PDIs range from 1.04\u20131.65) and moderate degrees of stereoselectivity were formed. Eight salalen Al(III) complexes have been prepared and fully characterised by solution-state NMR spectroscopy and, where appropriate, single crystal X-ray diffraction. With ligand 3H2 either a monomeric or dimeric Al(III) species was formed, the dimeric species was favoured at low concentrations. The complexes were tested for the ring opening polymerisation of rac-lactide in toluene at 80 or 100 \u00b0C. Interestingly, various tacticities of polymer were formed, which were dependent upon the nature of the group bound to the amine nitrogen centre.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Here we present atomistic simulations of the surfaces of olivine-structured NaFePO4 as a sodium-ion battery cathode, and discuss differences in its morphology compared to the lithium analogue LiFePO4. The calculated equilibrium morphology is mostly isometric in appearance, with (010), (201) and (011) faces dominant. Exposure of the (010) surface is vital because it is normal to the one-dimensional ion-conduction pathway. Platelet and cube-like shapes observed by previous microscopy studies are reproduced by adjusting surface energies. The results indicate that a variety of (nano)particle morphologies can be achieved by tuning surface stabilities, which depend on synthesis methods and solvent conditions, and will be important in optimising electrochemical performance.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "Citrate synthase (CS) catalyses the entry of carbon into the citric acid cycle and is highly-conserved structurally across the tree of life. Crystal structures of dimeric CSs are known in both \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d forms, which differ by a substantial domain motion that closes the substrate-binding clefts. We explore both the static rigidity and the dynamic flexibility of CS structures from mesophilic and extremophilic organisms from all three evolutionary domains. The computational expense of this wide-ranging exploration is kept to a minimum by the use of rigidity analysis and rapid all-atom simulations of flexible motion, combining geometric simulation and elastic network modeling. CS structures from thermophiles display increased structural rigidity compared with the mesophilic enzyme. A CS structure from a psychrophile, stabilized by strong ionic interactions, appears to display likewise increased rigidity in conventional rigidity analysis; however, a novel modified analysis, taking into account the weakening of the hydrophobic effect at low temperatures, shows a more appropriate decreased rigidity. These rigidity variations do not, however, affect the character of the flexible dynamics, which are well conserved across all the structures studied. Simulation trajectories not only duplicate the crystallographically observed symmetric open-to-closed transitions, but also identify motions describing a previously unidentified antisymmetric functional motion. This antisymmetric motion would not be directly observed in crystallography but is revealed as an intrinsic property of the CS structure by modeling of flexible motion. This suggests that the functional motion closing the binding clefts in CS may be independent rather than symmetric and cooperative.

The extrinsic flexibility window can be limited not only in compression, but also in expansion, as the beta-cages in a maximally expanded framework lack the flexibility to adapt bulky contents such as a combination of methanol and water molecules. Our simulations suggest a reinterpretation of extra-framework content nominally refined as water sites in compression experiments.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

The latest generation of high-flux neutron powder diffractometers, operating under optimised collection geometries, allow hydrogen positions to be extracted from the diffraction patterns of polycrystalline hydrogenous compounds without resorting to isotopic substitution. Neutron powder diffraction for hydrogenous materials has a wide range of applications within chemistry. These include the study of hydrogen-energy materials, coordination and organometallic compounds, hydrogen-bonded structures and ferroelectrics, geomaterials, zeolites and small molecule organics, such as simple sugars and amino acids. The technique is particularly well suited to parametric studies, for example as a function of temperature or pressure, where changes in hydrogen bonding patterns or decompositions involving hydrogen-containing molecules, such as water, are monitored.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Results show that even for hydrogen-containing materials data collected rapidly on a high-flux neutron diffractometer improve the refinement such that accurate positional and thermal displacement parameters can be extracted for all atom types. This contrasts with structural models extracted from either data set alone that demonstrate the inherent limitations of the individual diffraction methods. The rapidity with which useful neutron diffraction data has been collected from hydrogen-containing compounds, 10\u00a0min in this study, indicates that the technique should be widely applicable allowing the facile and accurate extraction of hydrogen positions for many compounds.",

Areas currently of much interest with respect to pyrochlores, include metal\u2013insulator transitions, magnetic frustration/spin ices, magnetoresistance, superconductivity, ferroelectrics, O/F ionic conductivity, mixed conductivity, pigments and catalysis. We present some recent results on three types of pyrochlore materials that show unusual magnetic, optical and electronic behaviours associated with subtle structural and compositional changes. High-resolution powder neutron diffraction studies of the superconducting Cd2Re2O7 and the ferroelectric Cd2Nb2O7 have been undertaken on material cooled below room temperature. Both Cd2Re2O7 and Cd2Nb2O7 exhibit small structure distortions, in each case involving a distortion from a cubic unit cell, on cooling below \u223c180 K and possible models that can be used to describe the low-temperature structures and associated atomic displacements are developed and described in this article.

This progress in cuprate solid state chemistry\r\nhas far outpaced that in many other areas of complex oxide chemistry. Significant\r\nnew developments have included the formation of new complex oxides incorporating\r\nthe volatile post transition oxides of Tl, Hg, Pb and Bi, the generation of\r\ncomplex structures based on stacked perovskites and/or other building\r\nblocks, the use of very high pressures during synthesis and the stabilisation\r\nof complex anions in oxides. Many of these advances are now being developed\r\noutside cuprate chemistry particularly with other late first row transition\r\nmetals such as iron, nickel and cobalt. The aim of this article is not\r\nto review cuprate chemistry but to demonstrate where work on high Tc\r\nsuperconductors has resulted in significant recent progress for other transitional\r\nmetal oxide systems. The syntheses and structures of these new complex oxides\r\nare described and areas where developments, derived from the discoveries in\r\ncuprate chemistry, can be expected in the next decade are also proposed.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

By obtaining neutron diffraction data from isotopically pure samples of the compositions Sc2(184WO4)3, Sc2(186WO4)3 and natural Sc2(WO4)3, coupled with multidata set refinement methods, it is possible to extract anisotropic thermal parameters for individual atoms throughout the temperature range. Results indicate that the thermal motion of two Sc\u2212O\u2212W bridging oxygen atoms with the largest Sc\u2212O\u2212W angles is better represented by thermal toroids consistent with strong local motion of these units. The thermal behavior of the other oxygen atoms in the structures as a function of temperature is normal. Sc\u2212O and W\u2212O bond lengths corrected for the effect of correlated thermal motion show the expected increase with temperature.  ",

In the former case the drive has been towards controlling electronic and magnetic properties while in the latter domain porosity and the ability to enclathrate small organic or inorganic units has been paramount. Semi-condensed framework materials, whose compositions and structures place them at the borderline of these two classes, are described in this article, such compound types include the sodalite, cancrinite, analcime, zeloites ABW and JBW and scapolite structures. In each case recent chemistry and developments are described particularly with respect to advances made at The University of Southampton. The potential for merging the properties and structures of these two classes of compounds are also discussed.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

The structure, at 150\u00a0K, space group Pbcn, lattice constants a = 14.6861\u00a0(4), b = 13.9799\u00a0(3) and c = 16.7063\u00a0(5)\u00a0\u00c5, consists of layers of stoichiometry (UO2)4O(OH)6, formed from edge-sharing UO7 pentagonal bipyramids, interleaved with hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Three of the layer hydroxyl groups are linked through hydrogen bonding to single water molecules and the three remaining OH units form interactions with water molecules that each act as acceptors in two hydrogen bonds. One of the water molecules in the inter-layer region is disordered over two symmetry-related sites and forms hydrogen-bonded interactions only within the layer and with the uranyl O atoms. The relationship of the structure of meta-schoepite to that of schoepite is discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA kinetic analysis of the hydroboration of iso-quinoline with pinacol borane (HBpin) and catalysed by a \u00ce\u00b2-diketiminato magnesium n-butyl pre-catalyst has provided evidence that the reaction proceeds via rate determining Mg\u2013N/H\u2013B metathesis of a dearomatised iso-quinolide anion. The reaction rate is suppressed by increasing [iso-quinoline] leading to the suggestion that catalytic turnover is also dependent on a pre-equilibrium involving dissociation of donor substrate molecules from the coordination sphere of the catalytic Mg centre. Stoichiometric reactions with a variety of poly-pyridine heterocycles have provided a range of magnesium derivatives of the dearomatised poly-pyridides either by alkyl or hydride transfer. The resistance of these latter species toward hydroboration is rationalised as a consequence of their additional coordinative stability providing corroborative evidence for the dissociative mechanism inferred from the kinetic analysis.",

Stoichiometric reactivity studies indicate that catalytic turnover ensues through the generation of magnesium aldimido, aldimidoborate and borylamido intermediates, which are formed in a sequence of intramolecular nitrile insertion and inter- and intramolecular B\u2013H metathesis events. Kinetic studies highlight variations in mechanism for the catalytic dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles, aryl nitriles bearing electron withdrawing (Ar(EWG)CN) and aryl nitriles bearing electron donating (Ar(EDG)CN) substitution patterns. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for catalysis performed with DBpin indicate that B\u2013H bond breaking and C\u2013H bond forming reactions are involved in the rate determining processes during the dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles and Ar(EDG)CN substrates, which display divergent first and second order rate dependences on [HBpin] respectively. In contrast, the hydroboration of Ar(EWG)CN substrates provides no KIE and HBpin is not implicated in the rate determining process during catalysis. Irrespective of these differences, a common mechanism is proposed in which the rate determining steps are deduced to vary through the establishment of several pre-equilibria, the relative positions of which are determined by the respective stabilities of the dimeric and monomeric magnesium aldimide and magnesium aldimidoborate intermediates as a result of adjustments to the basicity of the nitrile substrate. More generally, these observations indicate that homogeneous processes performed under heavier alkaline earth catalysis are likely to demonstrate previously unappreciated mechanistic diversity.\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

The electrode is placed at the aqueous electrolyte | gas interface, and current (cyclic voltammetry) as well as ambient differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS, cyclic voltbarometry) data are recorded as a function of solution composition and pH. The oxidation of oxalate to CO2 is employed as a test and calibration system. Anodic polarization of the carbon nanofibre membrane in inert aqueous electrolyte is shown to result in direct sustained anodic CO2 evolution. In alkaline aqueous media (starting at pH 9) significant levels of nitrogen from ammonia are produced in competition to CO2 formation from carbon nanofibres without the need for additional catalysts. However, for applications with low level ammonia, catalysts will be required to minimize current losses, carbon nanofibre corrosion, and side product formation.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": " The validity of the fractal versions of the FHH and BET theories for describing the adsorption of butane and nitrogen on a variety of partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces has been tested. The fractal dimensions obtained from adsorption data have been compared with those obtained completely independently using SAXS. It was found that the fractal dimensions obtained from butane adsorption isotherms, using both the fractal FHH and fractal BET theories, agreed well with the corresponding values obtained from SAXS over overlapping length scales. However, in general, a systematic deviation between the fractal dimension obtained from nitrogen adsorption and that obtained from SAXS was observed. The fractal dimensions obtained from nitrogen adsorption were consistently larger than those obtained from SAXS, which is the opposite of what has often been found in the literature. It has been suggested that the differences in the suitability of the adsorption theories tested to describe butane and nitrogen adsorption is due to the significant difference between the interaction strengths of these two different molecules with silica surfaces. A modified theory that can account for the discrepancy between the fractal dimensions obtained from nitrogen adsorption and SAXS has been proposed. The implications of the new theory for the accuracy of nitrogen adsorption BET surface areas for silicas are discussed.  ",

    "abstract": "AbstractMethods are developed for using a carbon nanofiber membrane electrode assembly (cnMEA) for three-electrode electrochemical measurements in unsupported liquid or gaseous media. The carbon nanofiber membrane (ca. 20\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm thickness) is hot-pressed from both sides onto a Nafion\u2122 ion conductor film (ca. 50\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm thickness). The resulting cnMEA is employed as both a counter electrode and working electrode (with an external SCE reference electrode) for the liquid phase oxidation of hydroquinone in (i) 0.5\u00a0M, (ii) 0.05\u00a0M, and (iii) 0.005\u00a0M aqueous NaHCO3, and (iv) in pure demineralised water. Well-defined voltammetric responses are obtained and pH effects are investigated. A gas\u2013salt (di-ammonium sulphate) contact between the cnMEA working electrode and SCE reference electrode is then employed in a gas flow system to obtain voltammetric responses in contact with a humidified gas (N2, 80% relative humidity). Reversible redox cycling of entrapped hydroquinone is demonstrated and humidity and pH effects are observed. Ammonia gas effects on Faradaic currents are explored. Voltammetric measurements provide direct insight into the MEA processes and conditions.",

The results show that Ti-doping leads to a general decrease in the conductivity, and an increase in activation energy, particularly for the range 1.0 \u2264 x \u2264 2.0. With reference to computer modelling and 29Si NMR data, this decrease in conductivity is attributed to trapping of the interstitial oxide ions around the Ti dopant. Attempts to prepare similar compositions containing La cation vacancies, i.e. La10\u2212ySi6\u2212xTixO3\u22123y/2, have a tendency to result in La2Ti2O7 impurities, particularly for high values of y.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Concentration and diffusion coefficient data are obtained for the reduction of oxygen and for the reduction of protons individually and simultaneously in saline (0.1\u2005M to 4.0\u2005M NaCl) electrolyte media. The diffusion coefficient and concentration data for oxygen allows salinity levels to be estimated. The microwire chronoamperometry method offers versatility and precision due to (i) a slow approach to steady state (when compared to microdisc methods) and (ii) insignificant viscosity effects (when compared to hydrodynamic methods).",

Three redox systems are employed in order to quantify the electrolysis cell performance. The one-electron reduction of Ru(NH3)63+ in the aqueous phase is employed to determine the rate of mass transport towards the electrode surface and the effect of the presence of the acetonitrile phase. The one-electron oxidation of n-butylferrocene in acetonitrile is employed to study triple phase boundary processes. Finally, the one-electron reduction of cobalticenium cations in the aqueous phase is employed to demonstrate the product transfer from the electrode surface into the organic phase.

Voltammetric methods are employed to investigate the effect of ultrasound on (i) the mass transport in the aqueous phase, (ii) the mass transport in the DCE\u2212aqueous two-phase system, and (iii) the triple-phase boundary anion extraction reaction coupled to oxidation of n-butylferrocene (nBuFc) in the organic phase. Optimized conditions comprise a 13 mm diameter ultrasonic horn (24 kHz) with 15 W/cm2 power output at a distance of 15 mm from a 2.83 cm2 glassy carbon working electrode in 32 cm3 of aqueous solution. Mass transport in the aqueous phase is probed for the reduction of hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride in aqueous 0.1 M KCl supporting electrolyte, and an increase in mass transport induced by the DCE droplets is observed. Triple-phase-boundary ion transfer reactions are studied for the oxidation of nBuFc in DCE in the presence of aqueous 0.1 M NaBPh4, KPF6, NaClO4, and phosphate buffer pH 1. The hydrophobicity of the transferring electrolyte anion is observed to shift the electrochemical response according to the standard transfer potential. For phosphate electrolyte media, rather than phosphate transfer, n-butylferricenium cation transfer into the aqueous phase and iron(III) phosphate formation occur. The beneficial effect of adding tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte into the organic DCE phase is demonstrated; however, triple-phase-boundary processes in the absence of intentionally added electrolyte in the organic phase are feasible.",

The insoluble salt is employed as a \u201csurface thin film electrolyte\u201d, with humidity causing electrical connection from the working electrode to the SCE counter-reference electrode. The organic solvents are employed without intentionally added electrolyte. Humidity in the nonpolar solvents is shown to be essential for the processes to work. The oxidation of decamethylferrocene is demonstrated as a test organometallic redox system. The electrochemical reduction of Au(III) in toluene (solubilized with tetraoctylammonium bromide, TOABr) is employed to demonstrate and visualize the reaction zone around salt crystal|working electrode contact points. Gold nanowire bundle formation is observed, presumably due to an ordered interfacial surfactant microphase at salt|electrode contact points. The triple phase boundary nature of these processes is discussed, and future applications are suggested.",

High concentrations of salt in the aqueous phase (2\u00a0M NaCl and 0.1\u00a0M NaClO4) ensure immiscibility and the polar nature of acetonitrile aids the formation of a well-behaved triple phase boundary reaction zone. The one-electron oxidation of tert-butylferrocene in the organic phase without intentionally added electrolyte is studied. The limiting current for the flowing triple phase boundary process is shown to be essentially volume flow rate independent. The process is accompanied by the transfer of perchlorate from the aqueous into the organic phase and the flux of anions is shown to be approximately constant along the dynamic acetonitrile | aqueous electrolyte | platinum line interface. A high rate of conversion (close to 100%) is achieved at slow volume flow rates and at longer platinum electrodes.",

Such structural control allows modification of film properties to potentially enhance their effectiveness for applications such as inorganic templating, encapsulation and molecular sensing.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

Irradiation with UV light, at 100 K, of single crystals of complexes 1\u20133 photoisomerise from the \u03b71-NO2 nitro form to the \u03b71-ONO nitrito form occurred. Complex 1 underwent 25% conversion to the nitrito form before crystal decomposition occurred. 2 and 3 underwent 46% and 39% conversion, respectively, to the nitrito form when a photostationary state was reached. While under the same experimental conditions 4 showed no isomerisation. The photocrystallographic results can be correlated with the results of DFT calculations and with the observed trends in the solution UV/visible absorption spectroscopy obtained for these complexes. The results suggest that while steric factors in the isomerization processes are important there may also be a kinetic effect relating to the lability of the metal involved.\r\n    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                        \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ",

    "abstract": "The solid-state, low-temperature linkage isomerism in a series of five square planar group\u200510 phosphino nitro complexes have been investigated by a combination of photocrystallographic experiments, Raman spectroscopy and computer modelling. The factors influencing the reversible solid-state interconversion between the nitro and nitrito structural isomers have also been investigated, providing insight into the dynamics of this process. The cis-[Ni(dcpe)(NO2)2] (1) and cis-[Ni(dppe)(NO2)2] (2) complexes show reversible 100\u2009% interconversion between the \u03b71-NO2 nitro isomer and the \u03b71-ONO nitrito form when single-crystals are irradiated with 400\u2005nm light at 100\u2005K. Variable temperature photocrystallographic studies for these complexes established that the metastable nitrito isomer reverted to the ground-state nitro isomer at temperatures above 180\u2005K. By comparison, the related trans complex [Ni(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (3) showed 82\u2009% conversion under the same experimental conditions at 100\u2005K. The level of conversion to the metastable nitrito isomers is further reduced when the nickel centre is replaced by palladium or platinum. Prolonged irradiation of the trans-[Pd(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (4) and trans-[Pt(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (5) with 400\u2005nm light gives reversible conversions of 44 and 27\u2009%, respectively, consistent with the slower kinetics associated with the heavier members of group\u200510. The mechanism of the interconversion has been investigated by theoretical calculations based on the model complex [Ni(dmpe)Cl(NO2)].",
