    "abstract": "Ionic transport in conventional ionic solids is generally considered to proceed via independent diffusion events or ``hops.'' This assumption leads to well-known Arrhenius expressions for transport coefficients, and is equivalent to assuming diffusion is a Poisson process. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the low-temperature $B1$, $B3$, and $B4$ AgI polymorphs, we have compared rates of ion hopping with corresponding Poisson distributions to test the assumption of independent hopping in these common structure types. In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed. In low temperature $B3$ and $B4$, diffusion is characterized by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops. Diffusion coefficients cannot be expressed in a simple Arrhenius form dependent on single-ion free energies, and intrinsic diffusion must be considered a many-body process.",

    "abstract": "This study shows that DNA (linearized plasmid, 4331 base pairs and salmon sperm, 2000 base pairs, respectively) adsorbs to model membranes of zwitterionic liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers in solutions containing divalent Ca2+ cations, and also in solutions containing monovalent Na+. The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles. In the presence of Ca2+, DNA induces the formation of multilamellar vesicles in which DNA intercalates the lamellae. Possible electrostatic and hydrophobic mechanisms for the adsorption of DNA in solutions containing monovalent salt are discussed and compared to the observations in divalent salt.",

In order to improve the catalytic process, a composite film electrode is developed based on (i) carbon microparticles of 2\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm diameter to enhance charge transport and (ii) a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (here PIM-EA-TB with a BET surface area of 1027\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121). The latter acts as a highly rigid molecular framework for the embedded free radical catalyst with simultaneous access to aqueous phase and substrate. The resulting mechanism for the oxidation of primary alcohols is shown to switch in reaction order from first to zeroth with increasing substrate concentration consistent with a kinetically limited process with competing diffusion of charge at the polymer layer-electrode interface (here the \u201cLEk\u201d case in Albery-Hillman notation). Reactivity optimisation and screening for a wider range of primary alcohols in conjunction with DFT-based relative reactivity correlation reveals substrate hydrophobicity as an important factor for enhancing catalytic currents. The PIM-EA-TB host matrix is proposed to control substrate partitioning and thereby catalyst reactivity and selectivity.",

It has been proposed that a part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway occurs in parallel in S. solfataricus, in which the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) is promiscuous for both glucose and galactose metabolism. Recombinant S. solfataricus KDGK protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in 0.1\u00a0M sodium acetate pH 4.1 and 1.4\u00a0M NaCl. The crystal structure of apo S. solfataricus KDGK was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 and a ternary complex with 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDGlu) and an ATP analogue was resolved at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5. The complex suggests that the structural basis for the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate KDGlu and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal) is derived from a subtle repositioning of residues that are conserved in homologous nonpromiscuous kinases.",

The approach is transferable and can be readily applied to more complex CNP\u2013clay systems. We predict that C60 molecules adsorb preferably on the mineral surface and that the most stable adsorption site is the ditrigonal cavity of the surface. The free energy of adsorption on pyrophyllite was calculated to be more favorable than aggregation both in a vacuum (\u22120.47 vs \u22120.41 eV) and in water (\u22120.25 vs \u22120.19 eV). In aqueous environments, there are energy barriers as the C60 molecule approaches either a surface or another C60 molecule, and these occur upon disruption of the hydration layers that surround each component. There are also free energy minima that correspond to outer-sphere and more favorable inner-sphere complexes. We expect this adsorptive behavior to be a general feature of CNP\u2013clay systems, and as clays are ubiquitous in the environment, it will offer an inexpensive remediative method to prevent the widespread impact of molecular C60 and CNPs.",

Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B1 structure is stable over all (Mg,Cd)O compositions, as expected from the preferences of the binary oxides. The (Mg,Zn)O alloy undergoes a tetrahedral to octahedral transition above 34% Mg content, in agreement with experiment. For (Zn,Cd)O, a transition is predicted above 62% Cd content.

The basal spacing values of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA) intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mont) in dry and water saturated states were detected using XRD. Then the results were compared with simulation results of dry CTMA-Mont. The MD simulations show that the CTMA cations form layer structures on siloxane surface and aggregate in the interlayer space. Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules. Although water molecules within interlayer space can form strong H-bonds as in bulk water the number of H-bond for each water molecule is reduced. Our results indicate that MD simulations represent a useful tool for exploring the microstructure of water saturated organoclays.\r                    ",

    "abstract": "The standard model of enhanced ionic conductivities in solid electrolyte heterostructures follows from a continuum mean-field description of defect distributions that makes no reference to crystalline structure. To examine ionic transport and defect distributions while explicitly accounting for ion-ion correlations and lattice effects, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic defects, with a difference in standard chemical potentials of mobile fluoride ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces. Non-charge-neutral ``space-charge'' regions, however, extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong lattice-mediated defect-defect interactions. We identify an atomic-scale ``Frenkel polarization'' mechanism for the interfacial enhancement in ionic mobility, where preferentially oriented associated Frenkel pairs form at the interface and promote local ion mobility via concerted diffusion processes.",

    "abstract": "Sodium periodate (NaIO4) is shown to be a milder and more efficient terminal oxidant for C\u2013H oxidation with Cp*Ir (Cp* = C5Me5) precatalysts than ceric(IV) ammonium nitrate. Synthetically useful yields, regioselectivities, and functional group tolerance were found for methylene oxidation of substrates bearing a phenyl, ketone, ester, or sulfonate group. Oxidation of the natural products (\u2212)-ambroxide and sclareolide proceeded selectively, and retention of configuration was seen in cis-decalin hydroxylation. At 60 \u00b0C, even primary C\u2013H bonds can be activated: whereas methane was overoxidized to CO2 in 39% yield without giving partially oxidized products, ethane was transformed into acetic acid in 25% yield based on total NaIO4. 18O labeling was demonstrated in cis-decalin hydroxylation with 18OH2 and NaIO4. A kinetic isotope effect of 3.0 \u00b1 0.1 was found in cyclohexane oxidation at 23 \u00b0C, suggesting C\u2013H bond cleavage as the rate-limiting step. Competition experiments between C\u2013H and water oxidation show that C\u2013H oxidation of sodium 4-ethylbenzene sulfonate is favored by 4 orders of magnitude.

This raises questions regarding the nature of the barriers that are holding back progress and whether current research is adequately addressing the key issues that are currently limiting device performance.

This concept is based on the generalization that a majority of pathogenic bacteria secrete virulence factors such as toxins and lipases that actively damage cell membranes, typically observed as tissue damage around infected wounds, while nonpathogenic bacteria do not (or not at high concentration). The eventual aim of this work is to produce responsive dressings which release antimicrobials and change color only on infected wounds.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "We have synthesized three new carbazole-based fluorescent boronic acid sensors to investigate the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the novel d-PET effect, in which the fluorophore acts as the electron donor and the protonated amine/boronic acid group as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (PET). Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed. Herein we propose that the orientation of the electron donor/acceptor may significantly affect the fluorescence modulation efficiency of the PET effect; this discovery will be important for the future design of PET sensors with improved fluorescence transduction efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP with high \u00ce\u00b2-PP content was prepared by a novel supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent, which was prepared with pimelic acid supported on nano-CaCO3 as support. The influences of the content of the support and supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent, pre-melting temperature (Tmelt) and scan rates on crystallization behavior and melting characteristics, and the \u00ce\u00b2-PP content of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD). The results indicated that the addition of supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent markedly increased the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Increasing the content of supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent slightly increased the Tc, but had no influence on the melting temperatures (Tm) of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP. The Tc and Tm of \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP decreased slightly with increasing the content of the support nano-CaCO3. The effects of scan rates and multiple scans with different Tmelt on the crystallization and melting behavior of PP nucleated by supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent are similar to that of PP nucleated by calcium pimelate (CaHA). The \u00ce\u00b2-PP content above 90 percent was obtained in PP nucleated by supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent and was not influenced by the content of nano-CaCO3. The supported \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent prepared by supporting pimelic acid on nano-CaCO3 is a \u00ce\u00b2-nucleating agent with high efficiency and selectivity, and low cost.",

    "abstract": " We have synthesized three new phenylethynylated carbazole boronic acid sensors, which were predicted to display novel d-PeT fluorescence transduction (PeT, photoinduced electron transfer; fluorophore as the electron donor of the electron transfer, ET) by DFT/TDDFT calculations. The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.",

Over the last decade, this research topic has been well developed thanks to the integration of boronic acid chemistry with a range of techniques, including supramolecular chemistry, materials chemistry, surface modification, and nanotechnology. New sensing strategies and platforms have been introduced and remarkable progress has been achieved to fully utilize the unique property of boron\u2013diol interaction and to improve the binding affinity towards different targets, especially under physiological conditions. In this review, the latest progress over the past 30 months (from late 2012 to early 2015) is highlighted and discussed to shed light on this versatile and promising platform for saccharide sensing.",

    "abstract": "Mineral oil microdroplets containing the model antioxidant N,N-didodecyl-N\u2032,N\u2032-diethyl-phenylene-diamine (DDPD) are immobilized into a 100\u00d7100 pore-array (ca. 10\u2005\u03bcm individual pore diameter, 100\u2005\u03bcm pitch) in a boron-doped diamond electrode surface. The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions. An extraction mechanism and the formation of a separate organic product phase are proposed to explain this behavior.",

Here we report their structural and electronic properties as calculated using a first-principles approach. We find that (i) the diverse range of crystal structures such as the monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal phases can all be derived from the zinc-blende structure with tetrahedral coordination. (ii) The energy stability of different structures is determined primarily by the local cation coordination around anions, which can be explained by a generalized valence octet rule. Structures with only Cu${}_{3}$Sn and Cu${}_{2}$Sn${}_{2}$ clusters around the anions have low and nearly degenerate energies, which makes Cu and Sn partially disordered in the cation sublattice. (iii) The direct band gaps of the low-energy compounds ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{SnS}}_{3}$ and ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{SnSe}}_{3}$ should be in the range of 0.8\\char21{}0.9 and 0.4 eV, respectively, and are weakly dependent on the long-range structural order.

It is also thought that Zn3N2 can be used as a starting material to achieve p-type conductivity in ZnO-based oxide homojunctions. In this work, the electronic structure of bulk Zn3N2 is studied using density-functional theory (DFT) with different approximations to the exchange-correlation functional, ranging from (semi-)local functionals to the quasiparticle G0W0 approach. We predict a bandgap in the range of 0.9\u20131.2 eV, reconciling the scattered values reported in experiments, and a remarkably low work function (ionisation potential) of 4.2 eV for the (111) surface.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called \u201cDNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors\u201d, DDIAS). In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively. A double stranded DNA intercalator with a ferrocenyl (Fc) redox marker was synthesized to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that the \u2018in-solution\u2019 method offers a favourable medium (in a homogeneous solution) for the binding between the aptamer and PSA, which shows to be more efficient than the \u2018on-chip\u2019 approach. DDIAS shows promising analytical performance under optimized conditions, with a limit of detection in the range of fM and low non-specific adsorption.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is a p-type semiconductor used in thin-film solar cells. To achieve high light-to-electricity conversion, annealing in the presence of CdCl2 is essential, but the underlying mechanism is still under debate. Recent evidence suggests that a reduction in the high density of stacking faults in the CdTe grains is a key process that occurs during the chemical treatment. A range of stacking faults, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and twin boundary, are computationally investigated to identify the extended defects that limit performance. The low-energy faults are found to be electrically benign, while a number of higher energy faults, consistent with atomic-resolution micrographs, are predicted to be hole traps with fluctuations in the local electrostatic potential. It is expected that stacking faults will also be important for other thin-film photovoltaic technologies.",

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized on gold electrodes with 6-mecarpto-hexanol to control the surface density of the ssDNA probe, and hybridized with complementary DNA. The binding of the Fc intercalator to dsDNA was measured by differential pulse voltammetry. This new biosensor was optimized to allow the detection of single base pair mismatched sequences, able to detect as low as 10 pM target ssDNA with a dynamic range from 10 pM to 100 nM. DNA extracted from wastewater was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting human-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The aim of this approach is to enable the analysis of population biomarkers in wastewater for the evaluation of public health using wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE).

In the all alloys, PP formed a continuous phase with a dispersive PA6. Effects of PA6 on the non-isothermal crystallization behavior, melting characteristics and the \u00ce\u00b2-PP content of alloys were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results indicated that the crystallization temperature (Tcp) of PP shifts to high temperature in the non-nucleated PP/PA6 alloys due to the \u00ce\u00b1-nucleating effect of PA6. However, in the \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP/PA6 alloys, PA6 hardly has an effect on the Tcp of PP. The \u00ce\u00b2-PP content in the alloys not only depends on the content of the PA6, but also on the melting temperatures. It is proved by etching the alloys with sulfuric acid that the nucleating agent mainly disperses in the PA6 phase and/or the interface between PP and PA6 when blended at high temperature. Addition of PP-g \u00a0-MA promotes the formation of \u00ce\u00b2-PP in the \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP/PA6 alloys. The increase in the PA6 content has a little influence on the Tcp of PP and the \u00ce\u00b2-PP content in the compatibilized \u00ce\u00b2-nucleated PP/PA6 alloys.

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein chips have demonstrated to be a sensitive and low cost solution to identify and detect tumor markers. However, efficient multiparametric analysis remains a challenge due to protein variability. Crucial parameters are the design of stable and reproducible surfaces which maintain biological activity of immobilized proteins, and immobilization conditions (buffer, pH, concentration). We have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions was evaluated on the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that each antibody displays variable biological activities depending on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Under optimized conditions, we can reach a limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10 pM. Our microstructured chip offers the possibility to implement a customized multiplex immunoassay combining optimal immobilization condition for each antibody on the same chip.",

To some extent, variation in the particle size and vesicle cavity diameter can be achieved by adjusting the anionic\u2013nonionic surfactant molar ratio. An onion-like vesicle morphology was obtained by changing the inorganic salt concentration. Based on the fitting of small angle neutron scattering data, a formation mechanism has been proposed.

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that robust mesostructured films will grow at the surface of alkaline solutions containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyethylenimine (PEI), and silica precursors. Here we have used time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering to investigate the structural evolution of the micellar solution from which the films form, at several different CTAB\u2013PEI concentrations. Simple models have been employed to quantify the size and shape of the micelles in the solution. There are no mesostructured particles occurring in the CTAB\u2013PEI solution prior to silica addition; however, after the addition of silicate species the hydrolysis and condensation of these species causes the formation of mesophase particles in a very short time, much faster than ordering observed in the film at the interface. The mesophase within the CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica particles finally rearranges into a 2D hexagonal ordered structure. With the aid of the previous neutron reflectivity data on films formed at the air/water interface from similar solutions, a formation mechanism for CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica films at the air/water interface has been developed. We suggest that although the route of mesostructure evolution of the film is the same as that of the particles in the solution, the liquid crystalline phase at the interface is not directly formed by the particles that developed below the interface.",

    "abstract": "The electronic structure and phase stability of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe were examined in the zinc-blende (B3), wurtzite (B4), and NiAs-type (B8) crystal structures using a first-principles method. Both the band-gap and valence-band maximum (VBM) deformation potentials of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe in the B3 structure were analyzed, revealing a less negative band-gap deformation potential from ZnTe to MgTe to CdTe, with a VBM deformation potential increase from CdTe to ZnTe to MgTe. The natural band offsets were calculated taking into account the core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd)Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe. However, the (Mg,Zn)Te alloy undergoes a B3 to B4 transition above 88% Mg concentration and a B4 to B8 transition above 95% Mg concentration. For (Mg,Cd)Te, a B3 to B4 transition is predicted above 80% Mg content and a B4 to B8 transition above 90% Mg concentration. Using the calculated band-gap bowing parameters, the B3 (Mg,Zn)Te [(Mg,Cd)Te] alloys are predicted to have accessible direct band gaps in the range 2.39(1.48)\\char21{}3.25(3.02) eV, suitable for photovoltaic absorbers.",

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements show that dried films maintain the same ordered mesostructure as the films at the air/water interface, and here the effects of PEI concentration and cross-linker (CL) on film mesostructure were investigated. Free-standing silica films were then synthesized by adding tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) to the surfactant\u2212polyelectrolyte solutions. Silica films have been studied by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and neutron reflectivity on as-synthesized films at the solution surface. Dried films have also been examined by SAXS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). On the basis of neutron reflectivity and SAXS data, a phase diagram for the CTAB\u2212PEI\u2212TMOS system has been drawn, and we propose a model for the formation of silica films synthesized with surfactant\u2212polyelectrolyte complexes.

Optimization of surface chemistry and spotting conditions are crucial parameters to enhance antibodies\u2019 immobilization efficiency and to maintain their biological activity. Here, we report the implementation of an antibody microarray for the detection of tumor markers involved in colorectal cancer. Three-dimensional microstructured glass slides were functionalized with three different aminated molecules ((3-aminopropyl)dimethylethoxysilane (APDMES), Jeffamine, and chitosan) varying in their chain length, their amine density, and their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. The physicochemical properties of the resulting surfaces were characterized. Antibody immobilization efficiency through physical interaction was studied as a function of surface properties as well as a function of the immobilization conditions. The results show that surface energy, steric hindrance, and pH of spotting buffer have great effects on protein immobilization. Under optimal conditions, biological activities of four immobilized antitumor marker antibodies were evaluated in multiplex immunoassay for the detection of the corresponding tumor markers. Results indicated that the chitosan functionalized surface displayed the highest binding capacity and allowed to retain maximal biological activity of the four tested antibody/antigen systems. Thus, we successfully demonstrated the application of amino-based surface modification for antibody microarrays to efficiently detect tumor markers.",

On the basis of fluorescence and 19F NMR studies, we have confirmed that the addition of fluoride to a boron center occurs prior to the formation of (C\u2013H)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F\u2013-type ionic hydrogen bond with the imidazolium moiety. More importantly, these investigations have demonstrated that only the receptor bearing the ortho-directed boron and imidazolium exhibits enhanced fluoride binding. The increased binding ability of the asymmetric bidentate receptor of ortho-boronic acid and imidazolium towards F\u2013 enables it to sense fluoride ions in a 95:5 CH3CN/HEPES aqueous solution. The fluorescence responses to different anions were also explored; the ortho-boron-imidazolium receptor displayed ratiometric fluorescence changes and a high selectivity towards fluoride ions over other anions (Cl\u2013, Br\u2013, CH3CO2\u2013, HSO4\u2013, and H2PO4\u2013).(\u00a9 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Film formation processes were probed by time-resolved neutron reflectivity measurements. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GID) measurements indicate that the mesophase geometry of the interfacial films could be controlled to give lamellar, 2D hexagonal, and several cubic phases (Pn3\u0305m, Fm3\u0305m, and Im3\u0305m) by varying the polyelectrolyte molecular weight, polyelectrolyte chemical nature, or the cationic:anionic surfactant molar ratio. On the basis of GID results, a phase diagram for the catanionic surfactant/polyelectrolyte/TMOS film system was drawn. These films can be easily removed from the interface and mesoporous silica films which retain the film geometry can be obtained after calcination; moreover, this film preparation method provides a simple way to impart polymer functionality into the mesostructured silica wall, which means these films have potential applications in a variety of fields such as catalysis, molecular separation, and drug delivery.",

Highly ordered anatase 2D-hexagonal mesoporous titania (meso-TiO2) nanoparticles with a high surface area and large pore size were fabricated. Meso-TiO2 was used as scattering particles and mixed with titania nanocrystallites at weight proportions ranging from 0 to 100%. Films made from the composites were used as scattering layers in DSSCs. The influence of meso-TiO2 proportion on the structure, morphology, and optical properties of the films were investigated. The results show that the films became more porous, with a larger surface roughness, and had higher surface areas and greater light-scattering effects when meso-TiO2 was incorporated. The performance of these scattering layers in relatively large, 1 cm2 area, DSSCs was studied to link cell performance to the detailed physical properties of the meso-TiO2/nanoparticle films. The optimum composition of scattering layers was obtained by mixing 50 wt % meso-TiO2 with titania nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProtein chips have demonstrated to be a sensitive and low cost solution to identify and detect tumor markers. However, efficient multiparametric analysis remains a challenge due to protein variability. Crucial parameters are the design of stable and reproducible surfaces which maintain biological activity of immobilized proteins. These parameters relate to surface chemistry and to immobilization conditions (printing buffers, washing etc.). In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that the biological activities of the immobilized antibodies were dependent on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Optimal immobilization conditions were different for each antibody. Limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10\u00a0pM can reach under optimized conditions. Our 3D microstructured chip offers the possibility to implement a customized multiplex immunoassay combining optimal immobilization condition for each antibody-antigen system on the same chip.",

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift. Monitoring the morphological variations of single GNRs enables us to track the transverse etching of GNRs at arbitrary time. This promises to be a useful method for the study of different nanomaterials and their spectral properties.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

In voltammetric measurements strong pH effects on capacitance and Faradaic current responses are observed due to chitosan forming a shell (or \u201chydrothermal wrapping\u201d) around both carbon nanoparticles and palladium particles in the water-based hydrothermal process. In spite of the wrapping, some Pd-catalytic processes are observed, but with pH controlling the rate. The shell around Pd nanoparticles appears to only allow small molecule reactants such as H2 and O2 but not formic acid or methanol to reach the active catalyst surface. Membrane-transport limited and reaction-type limited catalytic electrochemical responses are observed with high selectivity. Implications of small molecule selectivity and mechanistic selectivity in suppressing cross-over losses in fuel cell technology are discussed.",

In conventional electrochemical systems this process is conducted in aqueous phase and the resulting formation of poorly soluble CO2 gas can limit the kinetics. Here, an alternative electrochemical system with the gas phase in closer contact to the palladium nanoparticle catalyst is investigated based on a glassy carbon electrode and a solid salt electrolyte. It is demonstrated that the reaction zone of salt (here (NH4)2SO4 is most effective), palladium nanoparticle catalyst, and gas phase, is where the electrochemical oxidation process occurs. The effects of the type of salt, the partial pressure of formic acid, and the gas flow rate are investigated. Preliminary data for the oxidation of hydrogen gas at the salt|palladium|electrode contact are reported. A significant salt effect on the palladium catalysed reactions is observed and potential future applications of \u201csalt cells\u201d in sensing are discussed.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "A modular approach was proposed for the preparation of chiral fluorescent molecular sensors, in which the fluorophore, scaffold, and chirogenic center can be connected by ethynyl groups, and these modules can easily be changed to other structures to optimize the molecular sensing performance of the sensors. This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis. The boronic acid sensors were used for selective and sensitive recognition of disaccharides and glycosylated steroids (ginsenosides).",

Boronic acids follow lectin functions not just in being able to bind saccharides, but in multivalent saccharide binding that enhances both affinity and selectivity. For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures. In this review, we discuss supramolecular selective sensing of saccharides by using simple boronic acids in their aggregate forms, after a brief survey of the general aspects of boronic acid-based saccharide sensing.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed using dermatomed porcine skin. Post-treatment with nanoparticle formulations, the skin surface was either cleaned carefully with buffer or simply dried with tissue, and then immediately visualized by confocal microscopy. Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter. At the skin surface, Nile Red remained partly associated with nanoparticles, but was also released to some extent and penetrated into deeper layers of the stratum corneum (SC). In summary, polymeric nanoparticles did not penetrate beyond the superficial SC, showed some affinity for hair follicles, and released an associated \u201cactive\u201d into the skin.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); topical drug delivery",

    "abstract": "We have prepared chiral fluorescent bisboronic acid sensors with 3,6-dithiophen-2-yl-9H-carbazole as the fluorophore. The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.",

    "abstract": "In vivo monitoring of the biodistribution and activation of prodrugs is urgently required. Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.",

    "abstract": " The skin disposition of topically applied nanoparticles with varying degrees of hydrophobicity, composed of different proportions of polystyrene (PS) and poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA), and of an associated, model \u201cactive\u201d (Nile Red), was investigated. PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping",

Seven \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylates tested showed strong induced Cotton effects in the perylene absorption region around \u03bb=500\u2005nm, which were utilized for enantiomeric excess determination and chemo-discrimination of the analytes, with an average absolute error of 2\u2009% in ee determination and 100\u2009% correctness in analyte classification. Responses in the absorption spectra, which arise from the guest-enhanced aggregation, allow the determination of the sample concentration, thus enabling analysis of samples of unknown concentration and ee.

Single-crystal X-ray studies show that there is a significant reduction in the intertrimer Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au distances both with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure. In the four complexes, the reduction in temperature from 293 to 100\u2005K is accompanied by a reduction in the shortest intermolecular Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au contacts of between 0.04 and 0.08\u2005\u00c5. The solid-state luminescent emission spectra of 1 and 2 display a red shift with decreasing temperature or increasing pressure. Compound 3 does not emit under ambient conditions but displays increasingly red-shifted luminescence upon cooling or compression. Compound 4 remains emissionless, consistent with the absence of intermolecular Au\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5Au interactions. The largest pressure induced shift in emission is observed in 2 with a red shift of approximately 630\u2005cm\u22121 per GPa between ambient and 3.80\u2005GPa.

The mixed phosphates Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) are a fascinating new class of materials recently reported to be attractive Na ion cathodes which display low-volume changes upon cycling, indicative of long-lifetime operation. Key issues surrounding intrinsic defects, Na ion migration mechanisms, and voltage trends have been investigated through a combination of atomistic energy minimization, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory simulations. For all compositions, the most energetically favorable defect is calculated to be the Na/M antisite pair. MD simulations suggest Na+ diffusion extends across a 3D network of migration pathways with an activation barrier of 0.20\u20130.24 eV, and diffusion coefficients (DNa) of 10\u201310\u201310\u201311 cm2 s\u20131 at 325 K, suggesting good rate capability.

For 1, there is a smooth reduction in unit-cell volume of ~20% from ambient pressure to 4.45 GPa, followed by a dramatic reduction in volume that coincides with a 7.7% increase in the b axis length. Above the pressure of 5.38 GPa a smooth volume reduction continues. In contrast, for 2, there is a continuous change in unit-cell volume with an observed space group change from C2/c to P21/c, between the pressures of 4.15 and 5.70 GPa. In the crystals of 1 between 4.45 and 5.38 GPa adjacent molecules slide over each other and the dominant stacking interaction changes from a thiophene\u22efthiophene interaction at 4.45 GPa to a benzothiophene\u22efbenzothiophene interaction at 5.38 GPa and, within each molecule, the benzothiophene groups show a significant reorientation at the phase transition. In 2 there is a loss of molecular symmetry, concomitant with the change in space group, at the phase transition with the asymmetric unit changing from containing half a unique molecule to two independent molecules. The molecules show significant reorientations of their ring systems. The nature of the observed transition in 1 was investigated using solid-state computational methods to prove the superior thermodynamic stability of the high-pressure phase to the lower pressure phase at pressures above 5.38 GPa. Solid state UV-Vis spectroscopy of 1, over the pressure range from ambient to 15.4 GPa showed that the compound displayed piezochromism with a significant red shift in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* absorption band and a colour change in the crystal from colourless to red with increasing pressure.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Three aromatase inhibitors with sub-nanomolar potency, better than the benchmark agent letrozole, were designed.

Co-crystallisation is commonly used to alter the structure of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) without affecting its activity. A comprehensive co-crystal screen of four fenamic acid derivatives affords a strictly limited number of co-crystals. These show no evidence of polymorphism, although some of the parent APIs exhibit significant polymorphism. Two of these co-crystals, of mefenamic acid and tolfenamic acid with 4,4\u2032-bipyridine, were previously unknown and are studied using X-ray diffraction. Co-crystals from this screen are fully characterised and display comparable solubility and stability with respect to the parent APIs; no phase transformations have been identified. A range of crystallisation techniques, including cooling and grinding methods, are shown to afford single polymorphic forms for each of the co-crystals.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Almost complete dual inhibition is observed for 5 but the levels were reduced to 85% (aromatase) and 72% (sulfatase) after 24 h. DASI 5 did not inhibit aldosterone synthesis.

    "abstract": "AbstractExperimental studies of a range of molecular materials containing short, strong hydrogen bonding motifs are presented, with a particular focus on the determination of the hydrogen atom parameters in these materials under non-ambient and varying external conditions. Various experimental techniques have been developed and exploited, including the implementation of single crystal neutron diffraction on single crystals at pressures of up to 5\u00a0kbar and temperatures down to 30\u00a0K, the use of a multiple-crystal technique to facilitate data collection, and the exploitation of X-ray methods based on the imaging potential of Fourier techniques on evolving structures which have proven to be unexpectedly valuable in this context. The parallel application of advanced computational methods to the understanding of molecular structure in the solid state has also formed an important strand of this work.

Two alternative options for describing the shape of the solute cavity within the widely used polarized continuum model for implicit solvation were compared; the UFF and UA0 methods give equilibrium isotope effects (EIEs) that vary as a function of the dielectric constant in opposite directions. The same isotope effect was also obtained as the average over 40 structures from a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulation for the methyl cation explicitly solvated by many water molecules; the inverse value of the EIE agrees with UFF but not UA0. The opposing trends may be satisfactorily explained in terms of the different degrees of exposure of the atomic charges to the dielectric continuum in cavities of different shapes.",

The complex is electrochemically stable and strongly absorbing with a molar extinction coefficient at \u03bb(max) = 564 nm of 11700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 (in MeOH). Experimental and computational data indicate that the HOMO, LUMO and electronic excited state energy levels are appropriate for functionality in a DSSC. From cyclic voltammetry the HOMO is estimated to be \u22125.27 eV, as supported by computational work, which locates the HOMO at \u22125.78 eV. From electrochemical, absorption and emission experiments, the MLCT energy levels are expected to be appropriate for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Our computations support this and locate the key MLCT transition at 563 nm. Despite this, the efficiency in DSSCs is extremely low (<0.1%) suggesting that the dye does not inject excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " In this paper the immobilization of small unilamellar DMPC/GM1 lipid vesicles containing a water-soluble bodipy dye is described. The binding of the complete \u03b1\u03b2 toxin expressed by Vibrio cholerae to the attached vesicles was measured using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and a value of the dissociation constant Kd obtained. Further measurements showed that the interaction of both the \u03b1\u03b2-toxin and the \u03b2-subunit alone resulted in the permeation of the lipid membrane, with release of a fluorophore contained within the vesicle being measured by combined SPR and Surface Plasmon enhanced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (SPFS). The leakage of dye through the membrane, measured by following the change in fluorescence, was fitted to a simple diffusion model. Finally, SPFS measurements of the effect of europium(III) chloride (EuCl3) showed that cholera toxin binding and subsequent membrane permeation could be blocked by 1 \u00b5mol dm\u22123 europium chloride. In view of the low oral toxicity of europium chloride, we speculate on the potential pharmaceutical applications of this molecule in the treatment of cholera infection.",

    "abstract": "The wide availability of alcohols makes them useful building blocks in synthesis. It is generally necessary to activate the alcohol in order to facilitate nucleophilic substitution reactions for the construction of new CC or CN bonds. The activation of alcohols by the temporary removal of hydrogen has attracted a lot of attention from many research groups. Although the reactions showed considerable scope, substrates that act as good ligands for the catalyst tend to need higher catalyst loadings and temperatures in order to be successful. In general, relatively high temperatures and catalyst loading are required even for simple substrates. The identification of simple, cheap catalysts capable of achieving these reactions under milder conditions, ideally room temperature, remains a goal for using alcohols as alkylating agents.",

    "abstract": "Isotopic partition-function ratios and kinetic isotope effects for reaction of S-adenosylmethionine with catecholate in water are evaluated using a subset of 324 atoms within its surrounding aqueous environment at the AM1/TIP3P level. Two alternative methods for treating motion in the six librational degrees of freedom of the subset atoms relative to their environment are compared. A series of successively smaller subset Hessians are generated by cumulative deletion of rows and columns from the initial 972 \u00d7 972 Hessian. We find that it is better to treat these librations as vibrations than as translations and rotations and that there is no need to invoke the Teller\u2013Redlich product rule. The validity of \u201ccut-off\u201d procedures for computation of isotope effects with truncated atomic subsets is assessed: to ensure errors in ln(KIE) < 1% (or 2% for the quantum-corrected KIE) for all isotopic substitutions considered, it is necessary to use a less-restrictive procedure than is suggested by the familiar two-bond cutoff rule.",

    "abstract": "Appreciation for the contribution of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) to chemical reactivity predates transition-state theory (TST). Quantum corrections to rate constants for the reactions catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and the same reactions in water are estimated by Bell's one-dimensional approximate method and give tunnelling contributions to catalysis of 1.6 and 0.95, respectively. Published results for NQEs, including both tunnelling and zero-point energies, estimated by the quantum classical path method for LDH, carbonic anhydrase, glyoxylase I and lipoxygenase, together with the corresponding reactions in water, are reviewed: the respective contributions to catalysis are 0.66, 5, 1 and 1. In the absence of better evidence that an enzymic rate enhancement is due to a significantly larger quantum correction for the enzyme-catalysed reaction than for an appropriate uncatalysed reference reaction, it is suggested that the term \u2018quantum catalysis\u2019 should be used with caution and restraint.

    "abstract": "2D free-energy surfaces for transfer of the methoxymethyl cation between two water molecules are constructed from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which these atoms are treated quantum-mechanically within a box of 1030 classical solvent water molecules at 300 K. This provides a simple model for glycosyl transfer in water. The AM1/TIP3P surfaces with 2D-spline corrections at either MPWB1K/6-31+G(d,p) or MP2/6-31+G(d,p) contain a shallow free-energy well corresponding to an oxacarbenium ion intermediate in a DN*AN mechanism. MD analysis at three temperatures leads to a classical estimate of the lifetime of the methoxymethyl cation in water; when quantum corrections for vibrational zero-point energy are included, the lifetime is estimated to be about 1 ps, in agreement with the best experimental estimate. This suggests that computational simulation, with appropriate high-level correction, is a reliable tool to obtain detailed and reliable mechanistic descriptions for glycosidases. In view of the importance of developing improved anti-influenza drugs, simulations of sialidases that considered both sialyl oxacarbenium ion and covalent sialyl-enzyme as possible intermediates could provide particular insight.",

Products have been structurally characterised using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Reaction in fluoride-rich conditions produces chain, layer and three dimensional framework structures containing new and unusual structural features based on the linking of PO3F, PO2(OH,F)2 and Cu(O,F)n polyhedra (n = 4\u20136). Analysis of these structures, in terms of the copper coordination environments and their linkage dimensionalities, shows that these features are dependent on fluoride-content of the reaction medium and, therefore, the level of fluoride ion incorporation into the product materials. Structures exhibiting inter-layer spaces and channels frequently have these lined by terminal fluoride anions of the PO3F, PO2(OH,F)2 and Cu(O,F)n polyhedra.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The strong hydrogen bond that exists in this mineral has been accurately determined with the O\u2013H distance at 1.070(8)\u00a0\u00c5 and an O(donor)\u2013O(acceptor) separation of 2.481(5)\u00a0\u00c5 at 4\u00a0K, The distribution of hydrogen along the O\u2013O direction remains asymmetric between 4 and 850\u00a0K with the H atom being fully ordered at a single site, rather than partially disordered over two sites of a double-potential well, as in serandite. A gradual increase in the bonded O\u2013H distance at higher temperatures is observed, indicative of a broadening of the potential well in which the hydrogen atom is sited. Below 50\u00a0K, the material shows negative thermal expansion, likely to be associated with reduced bending motion of the O\u2013H bond.",

The molecular structures of several cyclopentadienylcopper(I) isocyanide complexes have been unambiguously determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes highlighted the isopropyl isocyanide complex [(\u03b75-C5H5)Cu(CNiPr)] (2a) and the tert-butyl isocyanide complex [(\u03b75-C5H5)Cu(CNtBu)] (2b) as possible copper metal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) precursors. Further modification of the precursors with variation of the substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligand system (varying between H, Me, Et, and iPr) has allowed the affect that these changes would have on features such as stability, volatility, and decomposition to be investigated. As part of this study, the vapor pressures of the complexes 2b, [(\u03b75-MeC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (3b), [(\u03b75-EtC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (4b), and [(\u03b75-iPrC5H4)Cu(CNtBu)] (5b) over a 40\u201365 \u00b0C temperature range have been determined. Low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD) was employed using precursors 2a and 2b to synthesize thin films of metallic copper on silicon, gold, and platinum substrates under a H2 atmosphere. Analysis of the thin films deposited onto both silicon and gold substrates at substrate temperatures of 180 and 300 \u00b0C by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy reveals temperature-dependent growth features: Films grown at 300 \u00b0C are continuous and pinhole-free, whereas films grown at 180 \u00b0C consist of highly crystalline nanoparticles. In contrast, deposition onto platinum substrates at 180 \u00b0C shows a high degree of surface coverage with the formation of high-density, continuous, and pinhole-free thin films. Powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) both show the films to be high-purity metallic copper.",

    "abstract": "A series of multinuclear Copper(I) guanidinate complexes have been synthesized in a succession of reactions between CuCl and the lithium guanidinate systems Li{L} (L = Me2NC(iPrN)2 (1a), Me2NC(CyN)2 (1b), Me2NC(tBuN)2(1c), and Me2NC(DipN)2 (2d) (iPr = iso-propyl, Cy = cyclohexyl, tBu = tert-butyl, and Dip = 2,6-disopropylphenyl) made in situ, and structurally characterized. The di-copper guanidinates systems with the general formula [Cu2{L}2] (L = {Me2NC(iPrN)2} (2a), {Me2NC(CyN)2} (2b), and {Me2NC(DipN)2} (2d) differed significantly from related amidinate complexes because of a large torsion of the dimer ring, which in turn is a result of transannular repulsion between adjacent guanidinate substituents. Attempts to synthesis the tert-butyl derivative [Cu2{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2] result in the separate formation and isolation of the tri-copper complexes [Cu3{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2(\u03bc-NMe2)] (3c) and [Cu3{Me2NC(tBuN)2}2(\u03bc-Cl)] (4c), both of which have been unambiguously characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Closer inspection of the solution state behavior of the lithium salt 1c reveals a previously unobserved equilibrium between 1c and its starting materials, LiNMe2 and N,N\u2032-di-tert-butyl-carbodiimide, for which activation enthalpy and entropy values of \u0394H\u29e7 = 48.2 \u00b1 18 kJ mol\u20131 and \u0394S\u29e7 = 70.6 \u00b1 6 J/K mol have been calculated using 1D-EXSY NMR spectroscopy to establish temperature dependent rates of exchange between the species in solution. The molecular structures of the lithium complexes 1c and 1d have also been determined and shown to form tetrameric and dimeric complexes respectively held together by Li\u2013N and agostic Li\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013C interactions. The thermal chemistry of the copper complexes have also been assessed by thermogravimetric analysis.",

The structures of these materials are formed from BO4 (BO3F) and As(O,OH)4 tetrahedra defining channels and interlayer regions containing either simple alkali metal cations or both cations and halide anions. These boroarsenate-based frameworks are unusual in comparison with other oxotetrahedral-based materials in that terminal OH, on As, may be present, decorating the inner surfaces of the channels, as in the 12-membered rings of K2[B(AsO3O)2H]. This unit also permits coordination to nonframework anions as well as cations, so that (Cs2[BAsO3OH]8[AsO4]2[CsCl4]Cl)2 (and its Br analogue) contains layers of [CsCl4]3- and Cl- ions separated and coordinated by the protonated boroarsenate framework.

The PEIS results were analysed using a phenomenological approach since the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction is not known a priori. The results indicate that the photocurrent onset potential is strongly affected by Fermi level pinning since the rate constant for surface recombination is almost constant in this potential region. The phenomenological rate constant for electron transfer was found to increase with potential, suggesting that the potential drop in the Helmholtz layer influences the activation energy for the oxygen evolution process. The PEIS analysis also shows that the limiting factor determining the performance of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 photoanode is electron\u2013hole recombination in the bulk of the oxide.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Eight salalen Al(III) complexes have been prepared and fully characterised by solution-state NMR spectroscopy and, where appropriate, single crystal X-ray diffraction.

The complexes were tested for the ring opening polymerisation of rac-lactide in toluene at 80 or 100 \u00b0C.

The calculated equilibrium morphology is mostly isometric in appearance, with (010), (201) and (011) faces dominant. Exposure of the (010) surface is vital because it is normal to the one-dimensional ion-conduction pathway. Platelet and cube-like shapes observed by previous microscopy studies are reproduced by adjusting surface energies.

    "abstract": "Citrate synthase (CS) catalyses the entry of carbon into the citric acid cycle and is highly-conserved structurally across the tree of life. Crystal structures of dimeric CSs are known in both \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d forms, which differ by a substantial domain motion that closes the substrate-binding clefts. We explore both the static rigidity and the dynamic flexibility of CS structures from mesophilic and extremophilic organisms from all three evolutionary domains. The computational expense of this wide-ranging exploration is kept to a minimum by the use of rigidity analysis and rapid all-atom simulations of flexible motion, combining geometric simulation and elastic network modeling. CS structures from thermophiles display increased structural rigidity compared with the mesophilic enzyme. A CS structure from a psychrophile, stabilized by strong ionic interactions, appears to display likewise increased rigidity in conventional rigidity analysis; however, a novel modified analysis, taking into account the weakening of the hydrophobic effect at low temperatures, shows a more appropriate decreased rigidity. These rigidity variations do not, however, affect the character of the flexible dynamics, which are well conserved across all the structures studied. Simulation trajectories not only duplicate the crystallographically observed symmetric open-to-closed transitions, but also identify motions describing a previously unidentified antisymmetric functional motion. This antisymmetric motion would not be directly observed in crystallography but is revealed as an intrinsic property of the CS structure by modeling of flexible motion. This suggests that the functional motion closing the binding clefts in CS may be independent rather than symmetric and cooperative.

We distinguish the intrinsic flexibility window of the framework from the newly defined extrinsic window limited by host\u2013guest steric interactions. The extrinsic flexibility window can be limited not only in compression, but also in expansion, as the beta-cages in a maximally expanded framework lack the flexibility to adapt bulky contents such as a combination of methanol and water molecules. Our simulations suggest a reinterpretation of extra-framework content nominally refined as water sites in compression experiments.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The analcime-like feldspathoids are a group of microporous minerals with the ANA framework topology. Analcime proper has predominantly Na as its channel cation content, while leucite contains predominantly K, pollucite contains Cs and wairakite contains Ca. Under compression, all these minerals display structural displacive phase transitions to low-symmetry forms at relatively low pressures (0.5\u20133.2\u2009GPa). We show, using geometric simulation, that these phase transitions are controlled by the \"flexibility window\" of the ANA framework, defined as the range of framework densities over which the tetrahedral units of the framework can in principle be made geometrically ideal. We discuss experimental compression data for these minerals and its relationship to the theoretical flexibility of the ANA framework, the influence of cation content, and framework ordering.",

The latest generation of high-flux neutron powder diffractometers, operating under optimised collection geometries, allow hydrogen positions to be extracted from the diffraction patterns of polycrystalline hydrogenous compounds without resorting to isotopic substitution. Neutron powder diffraction for hydrogenous materials has a wide range of applications within chemistry. These include the study of hydrogen-energy materials, coordination and organometallic compounds, hydrogen-bonded structures and ferroelectrics, geomaterials, zeolites and small molecule organics, such as simple sugars and amino acids. The technique is particularly well suited to parametric studies, for example as a function of temperature or pressure, where changes in hydrogen bonding patterns or decompositions involving hydrogen-containing molecules, such as water, are monitored.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Results show that even for hydrogen-containing materials data collected rapidly on a high-flux neutron diffractometer improve the refinement such that accurate positional and thermal displacement parameters can be extracted for all atom types. This contrasts with structural models extracted from either data set alone that demonstrate the inherent limitations of the individual diffraction methods.

This progress in cuprate solid state chemistry\rhas far outpaced that in many other areas of complex oxide chemistry. Significant\rnew developments have included the formation of new complex oxides incorporating\rthe volatile post transition oxides of Tl, Hg, Pb and Bi, the generation of\rcomplex structures based on stacked perovskites and/or other building\rblocks, the use of very high pressures during synthesis and the stabilisation\rof complex anions in oxides. Many of these advances are now being developed\routside cuprate chemistry particularly with other late first row transition\rmetals such as iron, nickel and cobalt. The aim of this article is not\rto review cuprate chemistry but to demonstrate where work on high Tc\rsuperconductors has resulted in significant recent progress for other transitional\rmetal oxide systems. The syntheses and structures of these new complex oxides\rare described and areas where developments, derived from the discoveries in\rcuprate chemistry, can be expected in the next decade are also proposed.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

By obtaining neutron diffraction data from isotopically pure samples of the compositions Sc2(184WO4)3, Sc2(186WO4)3 and natural Sc2(WO4)3, coupled with multidata set refinement methods, it is possible to extract anisotropic thermal parameters for individual atoms throughout the temperature range. Results indicate that the thermal motion of two Sc\u2212O\u2212W bridging oxygen atoms with the largest Sc\u2212O\u2212W angles is better represented by thermal toroids consistent with strong local motion of these units. The thermal behavior of the other oxygen atoms in the structures as a function of temperature is normal. Sc\u2212O and W\u2212O bond lengths corrected for the effect of correlated thermal motion show the expected increase with temperature.  ",

Three of the layer hydroxyl groups are linked through hydrogen bonding to single water molecules and the three remaining OH units form interactions with water molecules that each act as acceptors in two hydrogen bonds. One of the water molecules in the inter-layer region is disordered over two symmetry-related sites and forms hydrogen-bonded interactions only within the layer and with the uranyl O atoms.

The reaction rate is suppressed by increasing [iso-quinoline] leading to the suggestion that catalytic turnover is also dependent on a pre-equilibrium involving dissociation of donor substrate molecules from the coordination sphere of the catalytic Mg centre. Stoichiometric reactions with a variety of poly-pyridine heterocycles have provided a range of magnesium derivatives of the dearomatised poly-pyridides either by alkyl or hydride transfer. The resistance of these latter species toward hydroboration is rationalised as a consequence of their additional coordinative stability providing corroborative evidence for the dissociative mechanism inferred from the kinetic analysis.",

Stoichiometric reactivity studies indicate that catalytic turnover ensues through the generation of magnesium aldimido, aldimidoborate and borylamido intermediates, which are formed in a sequence of intramolecular nitrile insertion and inter- and intramolecular B\u2013H metathesis events. Kinetic studies highlight variations in mechanism for the catalytic dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles, aryl nitriles bearing electron withdrawing (Ar(EWG)CN) and aryl nitriles bearing electron donating (Ar(EDG)CN) substitution patterns. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for catalysis performed with DBpin indicate that B\u2013H bond breaking and C\u2013H bond forming reactions are involved in the rate determining processes during the dihydroboration of alkyl nitriles and Ar(EDG)CN substrates, which display divergent first and second order rate dependences on [HBpin] respectively. In contrast, the hydroboration of Ar(EWG)CN substrates provides no KIE and HBpin is not implicated in the rate determining process during catalysis. Irrespective of these differences, a common mechanism is proposed in which the rate determining steps are deduced to vary through the establishment of several pre-equilibria, the relative positions of which are determined by the respective stabilities of the dimeric and monomeric magnesium aldimide and magnesium aldimidoborate intermediates as a result of adjustments to the basicity of the nitrile substrate. More generally, these observations indicate that homogeneous processes performed under heavier alkaline earth catalysis are likely to demonstrate previously unappreciated mechanistic diversity.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The electrode is placed at the aqueous electrolyte | gas interface, and current (cyclic voltammetry) as well as ambient differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS, cyclic voltbarometry) data are recorded as a function of solution composition and pH. The oxidation of oxalate to CO2 is employed as a test and calibration system. Anodic polarization of the carbon nanofibre membrane in inert aqueous electrolyte is shown to result in direct sustained anodic CO2 evolution. In alkaline aqueous media (starting at pH 9) significant levels of nitrogen from ammonia are produced in competition to CO2 formation from carbon nanofibres without the need for additional catalysts. However, for applications with low level ammonia, catalysts will be required to minimize current losses, carbon nanofibre corrosion, and side product formation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " The validity of the fractal versions of the FHH and BET theories for describing the adsorption of butane and nitrogen on a variety of partially dehydroxylated silica surfaces has been tested. The fractal dimensions obtained from adsorption data have been compared with those obtained completely independently using SAXS. It was found that the fractal dimensions obtained from butane adsorption isotherms, using both the fractal FHH and fractal BET theories, agreed well with the corresponding values obtained from SAXS over overlapping length scales. However, in general, a systematic deviation between the fractal dimension obtained from nitrogen adsorption and that obtained from SAXS was observed. The fractal dimensions obtained from nitrogen adsorption were consistently larger than those obtained from SAXS, which is the opposite of what has often been found in the literature. It has been suggested that the differences in the suitability of the adsorption theories tested to describe butane and nitrogen adsorption is due to the significant difference between the interaction strengths of these two different molecules with silica surfaces. A modified theory that can account for the discrepancy between the fractal dimensions obtained from nitrogen adsorption and SAXS has been proposed. The implications of the new theory for the accuracy of nitrogen adsorption BET surface areas for silicas are discussed.  ",

The carbon nanofiber membrane (ca. 20\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm thickness) is hot-pressed from both sides onto a Nafion\u2122 ion conductor film (ca. 50\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm thickness). The resulting cnMEA is employed as both a counter electrode and working electrode (with an external SCE reference electrode) for the liquid phase oxidation of hydroquinone in (i) 0.5\u00a0M, (ii) 0.05\u00a0M, and (iii) 0.005\u00a0M aqueous NaHCO3, and (iv) in pure demineralised water. Well-defined voltammetric responses are obtained and pH effects are investigated. A gas\u2013salt (di-ammonium sulphate) contact between the cnMEA working electrode and SCE reference electrode is then employed in a gas flow system to obtain voltammetric responses in contact with a humidified gas (N2, 80% relative humidity). Reversible redox cycling of entrapped hydroquinone is demonstrated and humidity and pH effects are observed. Ammonia gas effects on Faradaic currents are explored. Voltammetric measurements provide direct insight into the MEA processes and conditions.",

Three redox systems are employed in order to quantify the electrolysis cell performance. The one-electron reduction of Ru(NH3)63+ in the aqueous phase is employed to determine the rate of mass transport towards the electrode surface and the effect of the presence of the acetonitrile phase. The one-electron oxidation of n-butylferrocene in acetonitrile is employed to study triple phase boundary processes. Finally, the one-electron reduction of cobalticenium cations in the aqueous phase is employed to demonstrate the product transfer from the electrode surface into the organic phase.

Voltammetric methods are employed to investigate the effect of ultrasound on (i) the mass transport in the aqueous phase, (ii) the mass transport in the DCE\u2212aqueous two-phase system, and (iii) the triple-phase boundary anion extraction reaction coupled to oxidation of n-butylferrocene (nBuFc) in the organic phase. Optimized conditions comprise a 13 mm diameter ultrasonic horn (24 kHz) with 15 W/cm2 power output at a distance of 15 mm from a 2.83 cm2 glassy carbon working electrode in 32 cm3 of aqueous solution. Mass transport in the aqueous phase is probed for the reduction of hexaammineruthenium(III) chloride in aqueous 0.1 M KCl supporting electrolyte, and an increase in mass transport induced by the DCE droplets is observed. Triple-phase-boundary ion transfer reactions are studied for the oxidation of nBuFc in DCE in the presence of aqueous 0.1 M NaBPh4, KPF6, NaClO4, and phosphate buffer pH 1. The hydrophobicity of the transferring electrolyte anion is observed to shift the electrochemical response according to the standard transfer potential. For phosphate electrolyte media, rather than phosphate transfer, n-butylferricenium cation transfer into the aqueous phase and iron(III) phosphate formation occur. The beneficial effect of adding tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte into the organic DCE phase is demonstrated; however, triple-phase-boundary processes in the absence of intentionally added electrolyte in the organic phase are feasible.",

Conventional 3 mm diameter glassy-carbon-disk electrodes are used in contact with a crystalline salt electrolyte (ammonium nitrate) immersed in nonpolar solvents. The insoluble salt is employed as a \u201csurface thin film electrolyte\u201d, with humidity causing electrical connection from the working electrode to the SCE counter-reference electrode. The organic solvents are employed without intentionally added electrolyte. Humidity in the nonpolar solvents is shown to be essential for the processes to work. The oxidation of decamethylferrocene is demonstrated as a test organometallic redox system. The electrochemical reduction of Au(III) in toluene (solubilized with tetraoctylammonium bromide, TOABr) is employed to demonstrate and visualize the reaction zone around salt crystal|working electrode contact points. Gold nanowire bundle formation is observed, presumably due to an ordered interfacial surfactant microphase at salt|electrode contact points. The triple phase boundary nature of these processes is discussed, and future applications are suggested.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAn amphiphilic carbon nanofibre membrane electrode (ca. 50\u00a0nm fibre diameter, 50\u2013100\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm membrane thickness) is employed as an active working electrode and separator between an aqueous electrolyte phase (with reference and counter electrode) and an immiscible organic acetonitrile phase (containing only the redox active material). Potential control is achieved with a reference and counter electrode located in the aqueous electrolyte phase, but the electrolysis is conducted in the organic acetonitrile phase in the absence of intentionally added supporting electrolyte. For the one-electron oxidation of n-butylferrocene coupled to perchlorate anion transfer from aqueous to organic phase effective electrolysis is demonstrated with an apparent mass transfer coefficient of m\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 and electrolysis of typically 1\u00a0mg n-butylferrocene in a 100\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcL volume. For the two-electron reduction of tetraethyl-ethylenetetracarboxylate the apparent mass transfer coefficient m\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 is lower due to a less extended triple phase boundary reaction zone in the carbon nanofibre membrane. Nevertheless, effective electrolysis of up to 6\u00a0mg tetraethyl-ethylenetetracarboxylate in a 100\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcL volume is demonstrated. Deuterated products are formed in the presence of D2O electrolyte media. The triple phase boundary dominated mechanism and future microreactor design improvements are discussed.",

High concentrations of salt in the aqueous phase (2\u00a0M NaCl and 0.1\u00a0M NaClO4) ensure immiscibility and the polar nature of acetonitrile aids the formation of a well-behaved triple phase boundary reaction zone. The one-electron oxidation of tert-butylferrocene in the organic phase without intentionally added electrolyte is studied. The limiting current for the flowing triple phase boundary process is shown to be essentially volume flow rate independent. The process is accompanied by the transfer of perchlorate from the aqueous into the organic phase and the flux of anions is shown to be approximately constant along the dynamic acetonitrile | aqueous electrolyte | platinum line interface. A high rate of conversion (close to 100%) is achieved at slow volume flow rates and at longer platinum electrodes.",

Experiments were conducted over a temperature range which led to calculation of a Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy of transfer for procaine hydrochloride. Successful application of this technique was confirmed using a second compound over a range of temperatures, namely caffeine. Overall, this work confirms that MLC can be used to determine precise and accurate partition coefficients that possibly more closely mimic biological membranes than traditional in vitro systems, namely octanol/water.",

Using quaternary ammonium surfactants with a range of packing parameters, we demonstrate that micelle shape in solution governs the ordered liquid crystalline phase found in the polymer-surfactant composite films. Such structural control allows modification of film properties to potentially enhance their effectiveness for applications such as inorganic templating, encapsulation and molecular sensing.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Irradiation with UV light, at 100 K, of single crystals of complexes 1\u20133 photoisomerise from the \u03b71-NO2 nitro form to the \u03b71-ONO nitrito form occurred. Complex 1 underwent 25% conversion to the nitrito form before crystal decomposition occurred. 2 and 3 underwent 46% and 39% conversion, respectively, to the nitrito form when a photostationary state was reached. While under the same experimental conditions 4 showed no isomerisation. The photocrystallographic results can be correlated with the results of DFT calculations and with the observed trends in the solution UV/visible absorption spectroscopy obtained for these complexes.

The factors influencing the reversible solid-state interconversion between the nitro and nitrito structural isomers have also been investigated, providing insight into the dynamics of this process. The cis-[Ni(dcpe)(NO2)2] (1) and cis-[Ni(dppe)(NO2)2] (2) complexes show reversible 100\u2009% interconversion between the \u03b71-NO2 nitro isomer and the \u03b71-ONO nitrito form when single-crystals are irradiated with 400\u2005nm light at 100\u2005K. Variable temperature photocrystallographic studies for these complexes established that the metastable nitrito isomer reverted to the ground-state nitro isomer at temperatures above 180\u2005K. By comparison, the related trans complex [Ni(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (3) showed 82\u2009% conversion under the same experimental conditions at 100\u2005K. The level of conversion to the metastable nitrito isomers is further reduced when the nickel centre is replaced by palladium or platinum. Prolonged irradiation of the trans-[Pd(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (4) and trans-[Pt(PCy3)2(NO2)2] (5) with 400\u2005nm light gives reversible conversions of 44 and 27\u2009%, respectively, consistent with the slower kinetics associated with the heavier members of group\u200510. The mechanism of the interconversion has been investigated by theoretical calculations based on the model complex [Ni(dmpe)Cl(NO2)].",

    "abstract": "The influence of different electrolyte cations ((Li+, Na+, Mg2+, tetrabutyl ammonium (TBA+)) on the TiO2 conduction band energy (Ec) the effective electron lifetime (\u03c4n), and the effective electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) was studied quantitatively. The separation between Ec and the redox Fermi level, EF,redox, was found to decrease as the charge/radius ratio of the cations increased. Ec in the Mg2+ electrolyte was found to be 170 meV lower than that in the Na+ electrolyte and 400 meV lower than that in the TBA+ electrolyte. Comparison of Dn and \u03c4n in the different electrolytes was carried out by using the trapped electron concentration as a measure of the energy difference between Ec and the quasi-Fermi level, nEF, under different illumination levels. Plots of Dn as a function of the trapped electron density, nt, were found to be relatively insensitive to the electrolyte cation, indicating that the density and energetic distribution of electron traps in TiO2 are similar in all of the electrolytes studied. By contrast, plots of \u03c4n versus nt for the different cations showed that the rate of electron back reaction is more than an order of magnitude faster in the TBA+ electrolyte compared with the Na+ and Li+ electrolytes. The electron diffusion lengths in the different electrolytes followed the sequence of Na+ > Li+ > Mg2+ > TBA+. The trends observed in the AM 1.5 current\u2013voltage characteristics of the DSCs are rationalized on the basis of the conduction band shifts and changes in electron lifetime.",

Attempts to use impedance spectroscopy to determine the electron diffusion length were unsuccessful due to overlap of the cathode and electron transport impedances. Values of the electron diffusion length in the range 5\u22128 \u03bcm were derived by IMPS/IMVS as well as by analysis of the ratio of the normalized photocurrent action spectra measured for illumination through the counter electrode and through the TiO2 electrode. These values indicate that loss of electrons by electron transfer to the Co(III) species will be important for TiO2 films thicker than about 5 \u03bcm, unless steps are taken to passivate the surface to retard back electron transfer.",

    "abstract": " A new steady-state method for determination of the electron diffusion length in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is described and illustrated with data obtained using cells containing three different types of electrolyte. The method is based on using near-IR absorbance methods to establish pairs of illumination intensity for which the total number of trapped electrons is the same at open circuit (where all electrons are lost by interfacial electron transfer) as at short circuit (where the majority of electrons are collected at the contact). Electron diffusion length values obtained by this method are compared with values derived by intensity-modulated methods and by impedance measurements under illumination. The results indicate that the values of electron diffusion length derived from the steady-state measurements are consistently lower than the values obtained by the non-steady-state methods. For all three electrolytes used in the study, the electron diffusion length was sufficiently high to guarantee electron collection efficiencies greater than 90%. Measurement of the trap distributions by near-IR absorption confirmed earlier observations of much higher electron trap densities for electrolytes containing Li+ ions. It is suggested that the electron trap distributions may not be intrinsic properties of the TiO2 nanoparticles but may be associated with electron\u2212ion interactions.",

BiVO4 is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor, despite having band extrema away from the Brillouin zone center. Coupling between Bi 6s and O 2p forces an upward dispersion of the valence band at the zone boundary; however, a direct gap is maintained via coupling between V 3d, O 2p, and Bi 6p, which lowers the conduction band minimum. These interactions result in symmetric hole and electron masses. Implications for the design of ambipolar metal oxides are discussed.",

Using band structure theory, we determine the energetics of possible intrinsic point defects in spinel CoAl2O4 and analyze their effect on its electronic and chemical properties. Extrinsic Fe-doping is also examined. Cation vacancies are found to be shallow acceptors, but their formation energy is sensitive to the growth conditions; an oxygen rich environment is required to enhance the p-type conductivity. Fe is an isovalent substituent on the Co (Al) site, exhibiting a preference for octahedral coordination, and forms a deep donor (acceptor) level near the center of the band gap, corresponding to a Fe(II) to Fe(III) transition.",

We report the stable and metastable stoichiometric clusters of (In2O3)n, where n = 1\u201310, as predicted from an evolutionary search within the classical interatomic potential and quantum density functional energy landscapes. In contrast to the paradigm set by ZnO, which favours high symmetry bubble-like structures, the In2O3 nanoclusters are found to tend towards dense, low symmetry structures approaching the bulk system at remarkably small molecular masses. Electronic characterisation is performed at the hybrid density functional and many-body GW levels to obtain accurate predictions of the spectroscopic properties, with mean values of the ionisation potentials and electron affinities calculated as 7.7 and 1.7 eV, respectively.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The small mismatch between LiMgN and LiZnN, along with electronic band gaps spanning the visible range, makes them good candidates. Calculations are performed using a first-principles band structure method, with the special quasirandom structure approach employed to generate the random alloys. Comparison of LiMgN and LiZnN with their binary nitride analogs is made, and the energetic and electronic effects of alloy ordering are investigated. These alloys exhibit negative mixing enthalpies atypical of traditional binary nitride systems, which is explained in terms of the low lattice strain and the chemical bonding effects of the interstitial Li ions.",

    "abstract": " The electronic structure of SnO, SnS, SnSe, and SnTe in the rocksalt, litharge, and herzenbergite structures has been calculated using density functional theory. Comparison of the distorted and undistorted structures allows for an explanation of the unusual experimentally observed structural transitions seen along the Sn(II) monochalcogenides. Analysis of the electronic structure shows a strong anion dependence of the Sn(II) lone pair, with the Sn(5s) and Sn(5p) states too far apart to couple directly. However, the interaction of Sn(5s) with anion states of appropriate energy produce a filled antibonding Sn(5s)\u2212anion p combination which allows coupling of Sn(5s) and Sn(5p) to occur, resulting in a sterically active asymmetric density on Sn. While the interaction between Sn(5s) and O(2p) is strong, interactions of Sn with S, Se, and Te become gradually weaker, resulting in less high energy 5s states and hence weaker lone pairs. The stability of the distorted structures relative to the symmetric structures of higher coordination is thereby reduced, which induces the change from highly distorted litharge SnO to highly symmetric rocksalt SnTe seen along the series.

We have performed a full atomic relaxation and calculated the electronic structure, using gradient corrected density functional theory, with the resulting structure in very good agreement with the previous experimentally determined unit cell. The computed density of states is in excellent agreement with our valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra. The combined results shed new light on the bonding and lone pair activity in this material.

We have performed density functional theory calculations on PbO and PbS in both the rocksalt and litharge structures which show anion dependence of the stereochemically active lone pair. PbO is more stable in litharge while PbS is not, and adopts the symmetric rocksalt structure showing no lone pair activity. Analysis of the electron density, density of states and crystal orbital overlap populations shows that the asymmetric electron density formed by Pb(II) is a direct result of anion\u2013cation interactions. The formation has a strong dependence on the electronic states of the anion and while oxygen has the states required for interaction with Pb 6s, sulphur does not. This explains for the first time why PbO forms distorted structures and possesses an asymmetric density and PbS forms symmetric structures with no lone pair activity. This analysis shows that distorted Pb(II) structures are not the result of chemically inert, sterically active lone pairs, but instead result from asymmetric electron densities that rely on direct electronic interaction with the coordinated anions.",

Further, we focus on the mechanisms of oxygen diffusion through the lattice, arising from anion Frenkel-pair formation, which is of particular interest for understanding the processes involved in radiation damage and catalysis. The thermodynamic barriers associated with the formation of the first stable anion Frenkel-pairs are 5.80\u00a0eV and 4.81\u00a0eV in cerium dioxide and indium sesquioxide, respectively; while for recombination, we calculate barriers of 0.78\u00a0eV and 0.23\u00a0eV.

The preference of these cations for non-centrosymmetric coordination environments has previously been rationalised in terms of direct hybridisation of metal s and p valence orbitals, thus lowering the internal electronic energy of the N-2 ion. This explanation in terms of an on-site second-order Jahn\u2013Teller effect remains the contemporary textbook explanation. In this tutorial review, we review recent progress in this area, based on quantum chemical calculations and X-ray spectroscopic measurements. This recent work has led to a revised model, which highlights the important role of covalent interaction with oxygen in mediating lone pair formation for metal oxides. The role of the anion p atomic orbital in chemical bonding is key to explaining why chalcogenides display a weaker preference for structural distortions in comparison to oxides and halides. The underlying chemical interactions are responsible for the unique physicochemical properties of oxides containing lone pairs and, in particular, to their application as photocatalysts (BiVO4), ferroelectrics (PbTiO3), multi-ferroics (BiFeO3) and p-type semiconductors (SnO).

While tails of localized states may be created above the valence band, the highly delocalized conduction band remains unperturbed, offering effective n-type conduction despite the existence of long-range structural disorder. This is in direct contrast to the paradigm set by amorphous covalent semiconductors.",

From investigation of the magnitude and origin of these shifts through density-functional band-structure theory, we demonstrate that the key contribution to renormalization arises from the nonparabolic nature of the host conduction band but not the rigid shift of the band edges, as is the current paradigm. Furthermore, the carrier dependence of the band-gap widening is highly sensitive to the electronic states of the dopant ion, which can be involved in a significant reconstruction of the lower conduction band.",

With respect to the stability of free electron and hole carriers, redoxreactions resulting in charge compensation by ionic defects are found to be largelyendothermic (unfavourable) for electrons and exothermic (favourable) for holes,which is consistent with the efficacy of electron conduction in these materials.Approaches for overcoming these fundamental thermodynamic limits are discussed.",

The potential is optimized for the thermodynamically stable bixbyite phase, and it is then used to explore the relative stability and physical properties of five sesquioxide polymorphs and their high-pressure phase transitions. The potential is further employed to investigate the formation of intrinsic defects at the limit of infinite dilution through the embedded Mott\u2212Littleton approach. The anion Frenkel pair is determined to be the lowest energy source of ionic disorder with an energy of formation of 3.2 eV per defect, which can be explained by the presence of intrinsic anion vacancy sites in the bixbyite structure. In contrast, both the cation Frenkel pair (6.9 eV) and Schottky defect (4.4 eV) are less thermodynamically stable. The Schottky formation energy is less in the high pressure phases; however, it remains above 4 eV at elevated pressures.",

A 1933 report of the synthesis of CuF in the sphalerite structure has never been reproduced, however, it consistently appears in textbooks and databases. We report the results from a computational study of CuF based on a hybrid density functional theory (DFT) approach and identify the cinnabar crystal structure as an energy minimum, which incorporates linear F\u2013Cu\u2013F chains that are characteristic of the Cu(I) ion. Assessment of the oxidation and disproportionation reactions reveals that while CuF is thermodynamically stable with respect to the standard state, it can be oxidised readily to form CuF2. Moreover, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the linear F\u2013Cu\u2013F chains have a low barrier to rotation, so that at moderate temperatures the material might not give rise to a clear diffraction pattern. The predicted ionization potential of 6.5 eV, with respect to the vacuum level, suggests that the material may be suitable for photochemical applications through the formation of a heterostructure with Cu2O and/or ZnO.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Scientists have developed theories and models for electron energies in a variety of chemical systems over the past century. However, the prediction of quantitative energy levels in new materials remains a major challenge. This issue is of particular importance in metal oxide research, where novel chemistries have opened the possibility of a wide range of tailored systems with applications in important fields including light-emitting diodes, energy efficient glasses, and solar cells.In this Account, we discuss the application of atomistic modeling techniques, covering the spectrum from classical to quantum descriptions, to explore the alignment of electron energies between materials. We present a number of paradigmatic examples, including a series of oxides (ZnO, In2O3, and Cu2O). Such calculations allow the determination of a \u201cband alignment diagram\u201d between different materials and can facilitate the prediction of the optimal chemical composition of an oxide for use in a given application.Throughout this Account, we consider direct computational solutions in the context of heuristic models, which are used to relate the fundamental theory to experimental observations. We review a number of techniques that have been commonly applied in the study of electron energies in solids. These models have arisen from different answers to the same basic question, coming from solid-state chemistry and physics perspectives. We highlight common factors, as well as providing a critical appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of each, emphasizing the difficulties in translating concepts from molecular to solid-state systems.Finally, we stress the need for a universal description of the alignment of band energies for materials design from first-principles. By demonstrating the applicability and challenges of using theory to calculate the relevant quantities, as well as impressing the necessity of a clarification and unification of the descriptions, we hope to provide a stimulus for the continued development of this field.",

    "abstract": "The performance of solar cells based on hybrid halide perovskites has seen an unparalleled rate of progress, while our understanding of the underlying physical chemistry of these materials trails behind. Superficially, CH3NH3PbI3 is similar to other thin-film photovoltaic materials: a semiconductor with an optical band gap in the optimal region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Microscopically, the material is more unconventional. Progress in our understanding of the local and long-range chemical bonding of hybrid perovskites is discussed here, drawing from a series of computational studies involving electronic structure, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The orientational freedom of the dipolar methylammonium ion gives rise to temperature-dependent dielectric screening and the possibility for the formation of polar (ferroelectric) domains. The ability to independently substitute on the A, B, and X lattice sites provides the means to tune the optoelectronic properties. Finally, ten critical challenges and opportunities for physical chemists are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Metal oxides are typically insulating materials that can be made conductive through aliovalent doping and/or non-stoichiometry. Recent studies have identified conductive states at surfaces and interfaces of pure oxide materials; high electron concentrations are present, resulting in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate for In2O3 that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy decreases rapidly towards the (111) surface, where the coordination environment is lowered. This is a general feature of metal oxide systems that can result in a metal\u2013insulator transition where donors are produced at chemically reduced extended defects.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA series of mixed-cation organoclays, containing both Fe3+ and choline+ cations, were prepared using montmorillonite and tested for catalytic activity in three Fe3+-mediated reactions: the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol, coupling of anthrone and a Lewis-acid catalysed indole conjugate addition. Clays with different Fe3+:choline+ ratios were required to achieve maximum catalytic activity in each reaction. For coupling of both 2-naphthol and anthrone, the most effective catalysts, as measured by the turnover frequency (TOF), were mixed Fe3+/choline+ clays of varying ratios, but the catalytic efficiency of Fe3+ montmorillonite in the conjugate addition of indole with methyl vinyl ketone decreased with the addition of choline+. This result could potentially be explained by the effect of choline+ decreasing the accessibility of Lewis acid domains. The results of this study provide proof that it is possible to tune mixed-cation clays with maximum catalytic activity in specific reaction types for specific substrates. Such mixed-cation organoclays offer advantages over traditional clay-based sorbents in environmental remediation applications, as they have the potential to bind organic contaminants selectively, via interaction with surface-exchanged organic cations, and neutralise organic molecules through catalytic exchange cations that are also present on the clay surface.",

    "abstract": "Fe(III) montmorillonite clay that was partially exchanged with hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA+) cations achieved increased catalytic activity for the oxidative coupling of hydrophobic organic substrates. A series of mixed-cation organoclays were produced, where the organic cation content ranged from 6 to 50% relative to the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the clay, and were tested for catalytic activity using different Fe(III)-mediated oxidative coupling reactions. Enhanced catalytic activity by Fe3+/HDTMA+ montmorillonite for coupling hydrophobic substrates was observed, with maximum catalytic activity in the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol observed at 6% HDTMA+ coverage. However, maximum catalytic activity with a more hydrophobic substrate, anthrone, was achieved with 50% HDTMA+ coverage, indicating that matching levels of organic modification to substrate hydrophobicity improves catalytic activity. The organization of the organic cations at the clay surfaces proved to be heterogeneous, as determined by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and powder X-ray diffraction. Results from molecular dynamics simulations supported the heterogeneous nature of the catalysts but also pointed toward large regions within the interlayers that may be filled with nonreactive hydrated Fe oxides resulting from the organic cation treatment. The exchangeable Fe content of the organic treated clays, as determined by AAS and ICP measurements, was observed to be higher than expected relative to that of Fe-saturated clay, substantiating this hypothesis. These findings have implications for the development of substrate-specific clay catalysts, where the composition and configuration of exchangeable cations can be matched to a particular substrate or reaction.",

Gas sensors have a role to play in this process, since they can provide real time feedback to vehicular fuel and emissions management systems as well as reducing the discrepancy between emissions observed in factory tests and \u2018real world\u2019 scenarios. In this review we survey the current state-of-the-art in using porous materials for sensing the gases relevant to automotive emissions. Two broad classes of porous material \u2013 zeolites and metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) \u2013 are introduced, and their potential for gas sensing is discussed. The adsorptive, spectroscopic and electronic techniques for sensing gases using porous materials are summarised. Examples of the use of zeolites and MOFs in the sensing of water vapour, oxygen, NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen are then detailed. Both types of porous material (zeolites and MOFs) reveal great promise for the fabrication of sensors for exhaust gases and vapours due to high selectivity and sensitivity. The size and shape selectivity of the zeolite and MOF materials are controlled by variation of pore dimensions, chemical composition (hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity), crystal size and orientation, thus enabling detection and differentiation between different gases and vapours.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The piroxicam molecule can exist in two possible tautomers, one of which is zwitterionic; the PX tautomer obtained in these complexes is not related to the type of substituent or substitution position. Instead, a correlation is seen between the pKa of the benzoic acid co-molecule and the preference towards a particular PX tautomer. The complexes with 2-, 3- and 4-fluorobenzoic acids exhibit the rare phenomenon of tautomeric polymorphism. DSC measurements have been used to identify the most thermodynamically stable polymorph in these cases and this has been rationalised by consideration of the intermolecular interactions in the crystal structures. The complexes containing zwitterionic piroxicam (PXZ) display a highly predictable and reproducible four-molecule tetrameric hydrogen bonding pattern whereas the complexes containing non-ionised piroxicam have more than one possible hydrogen bonding synthon.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Detailed analysis of the thermal response of these water-swollen films by means of surface plasmon resonance and optical waveguide spectroscopy revealed that the composite is very stable and has excellent responsive properties; it is of high optical homogeneity; admixture of the nanoparticles (up to 50%-wt) does not affect the critical volume collapse temperature; and swell-collapse cycles are highly reproducible and display only limited hysteresis.

Oxidation of Co(II)phthalocyanine at the generator electrode was shown to be associated with anion transfer from the aqueous into the organic phase. The corresponding back reduction at the collector electrode with anion expulsion was delayed by the anion/cation diffusion time across the interelectrode gap. A working curve based on a finite difference numerical simulation model was employed to estimate the apparent diffusion coefficients for anions in the organic phase (PF6\u2212<ClO4\u2212<NO3\u2212).

    "abstract": "A novel way to produce ultrathin transparent carbon layers on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates is developed. The ITO surface is coated with cellulose nanofibrils (from sisal) via layer-by-layer electrostatic binding with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) or PDDAC acting as the binder. The cellulose nanofibril-PDDAC composite film is then vacuum-carbonised at 500\u2009\u00b0C. The resulting carbon films are characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and Raman methods. Smooth carbon films with good adhesion to the ITO substrate are formed. The electrochemical characterisation of the carbon films is based on the oxidation of hydroquinone and the reduction of benzoquinone in aqueous phosphate buffer media. A modest effect of the cellulose nanofibril-PDDAC film on the rate of electron transfer is observed. The effect of the film on the rate of electron transfer after carbonisation is more dramatic. For a 40-layer cellulose nanofibril-PDDAC film after carbonisation a two-order of magnitude change in the rate of electron transfer occurs presumably due to a better interaction of the hydroquinone/benzoquinone system with the electrode surface.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCellulose nano-whiskers or nanocrystals are used as a carbon source in a vacuum graphitisation process to surface-modify nano-TiO2 and influence its photoreactivity. In sharp contrast to bulk carbon-modified TiO2 materials, introducing cellulose in a controlled way, i.e., a layer-by-layer deposition process, allows thin film materials to be created with low graphite content, but with strongly suppressed responses to light. The effect is explained by highly effective surface recombination and demonstrated for the I3\u2212/I\u2212 redox system in acetonitrile and for the photo-oxidation of acetate in aqueous media.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical determination of redox active dye species is demonstrated in indigo samples contaminated with high levels of organic and inorganic impurities. The use of a hydrodynamic electrode system based on a vibrating probe (250\u00a0Hz, 200\u00a0\u03bcm lateral amplitude) allows time-independent diffusion controlled signals to be enhanced and reliable concentration data to be obtained under steady state conditions at relatively fast scan rates up to 4\u00a0V\u00a0s\u22121. In this work the indigo content of a complex plant-derived indigo sample (dye content typically 30%) is determined after indigo is reduced by addition of glucose in aqueous 0.2\u00a0M NaOH. The soluble leuco-indigo is measured by its oxidation response at a vibrating electrode. The vibrating electrode, which consisted of a laterally vibrating 500\u00a0\u03bcm diameter gold disc, is calibrated with Fe(CN)6                            3\u2212/4\u2212 in 0.1\u00a0M KCl and employed for indigo determination at 55, 65, and 75\u00a0\u00b0C in 0.2\u00a0M NaOH. Determinations of the indigo content of 25 different samples of plant-derived indigo are compared with those obtained by conventional spectrophotometry. This comparison suggests a significant improvement by the electrochemical method, which appears to be less sensitive to impurities.",

Indigo reduction is driven by glucose in aqueous NaOH and a vibrating gold disc electrode is employed to monitor the increasing leuco-indigo concentration with time. Anthraquinone introduces a strong catalytic effect which is explained by invoking a molecular \u201cwedge effect\u201d during co-intercalation of Na+ and anthraquinone into the layered indigo crystal structure. The glucose-driven indigo reduction, which is ineffective in 0.1 M NaOH at 65 \u00b0C, becomes facile and goes to completion in the presence of anthraquinone catalyst. Electron microscopy of indigo crystals before and after reductive dissolution confirms a delamination mechanism initiated at the edges of the plate-like indigo crystals. Catalysis occurs when the anthraquinone\u2013indigo mixture reaches a molar ratio of 1:400 (at 65 \u00b0C; corresponding to 3 \u03bcM anthraquinone) with excess of anthraquinone having virtually no effect. A strong temperature effect (with a composite EA\u2248 120 kJ mol\u22121) is observed for the reductive dissolution in the presence of anthraquinone. The molar ratio and temperature effects are both consistent with the heterogeneous nature of the anthraquinone catalysis in the aqueous reaction mixture.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " Tethered bilayer lipid membranes are stable solid supported model membrane systems. They can be used to investigate the incorporation and function of membrane proteins. In order to study ion translocation mediated via incorporated proteins, insulating membranes are necessary. The architecture of the membrane can have an important effect on both the electrical properties of the lipid bilayer as well as on the possibility to functionally host proteins. \u03b1-Hemolysin pores have been functionally incorporated into a tethered bilayer lipid membrane coupled to a gold electrode. The protein incorporation has been monitored optically and electrically and the influence of the molecular structure of the anchor lipids on the insertion properties has been investigated.  ",

    "abstract": "17\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type\u20051 (17\u03b2-HSD1), an oxidoreductase which has a preferential reductive activity using NADPH as cofactor, converts estrone to estradiol and is expressed in many steroidogenic tissues including breast and in malignant breast cells. As estradiol stimulates the growth and development of hormone-dependent breast cancer, inhibition of the final step of its synthesis is an attractive target for the treatment of this disease. The parallel synthesis of novel focused libraries of 16-substituted estrone derivatives and modified E-ring pyrazole steroids as new potent 17\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors is described. Substituted 3-O-sulfamoylated estrone derivatives were used as templates and were immobilised on 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin to give resin-bound scaffolds with a multi-detachable linker. Novel focused libraries of 16-substituted estrone derivatives and new modified E-ring steroids were assembled from these immobilised templates using solid-phase organic synthesis and solution-phase methodologies. Among the derivatives synthesised, the most potent 17\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors were 25 and 26 with IC50 values in T-47D human breast cancer cells of 27 and 165\u2005nm, respectively. Parallel synthesis resulting in a library of C5\u2032-linked amides from the pyrazole E-ring led to the identification of 62 with an IC50 value of 700\u2005nM. These potent inhibitors of 17\u03b2-HSD1 have a 2-ethyl substituent which will decrease their estrogenic potential. Several novel 17\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors emerged from these libraries and these provide direction for further template exploration in this area. A new efficient diastereoselective synthesis of 25 has also been developed to facilitate supply for in\u2005vivo evaluation, and an X-ray crystal structure of this inhibitor is presented.",

    "abstract": "The electron collection efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is usually related to the electron diffusion length, L = (D\u03c4)1/2, where D is the diffusion coefficient of mobile electrons and \u03c4 is their lifetime, which is determined by electron transfer to the redox electrolyte. Analysis of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for front and rear illumination consistently gives smaller values of L than those derived from small amplitude methods. We show that the IPCE analysis is incorrect if recombination is not first-order in free electron concentration, and we demonstrate that the intensity dependence of the apparent L derived by first-order analysis of IPCE measurements and the voltage dependence of L derived from perturbation experiments can be fitted using the same reaction order, \u03b3 \u2248 0.8. The new analysis presented in this letter resolves the controversy over why L values derived from small amplitude methods are larger than those obtained from IPCE data.Keywords (keywords):  diffusion length; IPCE; impedance; IMPS; IMVS",

    "abstract": "AbstractChemically surface-modified (tosyl-functionalized) carbon nanoparticles (Emperor 2000 from Cabot Corp.) are employed for the extraction and electrochemical determination of phenolic impurities such as benzophenone-3 (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone) or triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol). The hydrophilic carbon nanoparticles are readily suspended and separated by centrifugation prior to deposition onto suitable electrode surfaces and voltammetric analysis. Voltammetric peaks provide concentration information over a 10\u2013100\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM range and an estimated limit of detection of ca. 10\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM (or 2.3\u00a0ppm) for benzophenone-3 and ca. 20\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM (or 5.8\u00a0ppm) for triclosan.Alternatively, analyte-free carbon nanoparticles immobilized at a graphite or glassy carbon electrode surface and directly immersed in analyte solution bind benzophenone-3 and triclosan (both with an estimated Langmuirian binding constants of K\u00a0\u2248\u00a06000\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0dm3 at pH 9.5) and they also give characteristic voltammetric responses (anodic for triclosan and cathodic for benzophenone-3) with a linear range of ca. 1\u2013120\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM. The estimated limit of detection is improved to ca.5\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM (or 1.2\u00a0ppm) for benzophenone-3 and ca. 10\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM (or 2.3\u00a0ppm) for triclosan. Surface functionalization is discussed as the key to further improvements in extraction and detection efficiency.",

Degradation efficiency of WWTPs was found to be compound and enantiomer dependent. Selective enantiomer enrichment was observed for several target analytes. Amphetamine and MDMA were enriched with R(\u2212)-enantiomers. 1S,2S(+)-pseudoephedrine was found to be more readily degradable during activated sludge treatment than its diastereomer 1R,2S(\u2212)-ephedrine. Atenolol underwent enrichment with either S(\u2212)- or R(+)-enantiomer in different WWTPs. This unexpected enantiomeric variation in the stereoselective degradation of atenolol could be attributed to different processes utilized during activated sludge treatment.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe use of immobilised TiO2 for the purification of polluted water streams introduces the necessity to evaluate the effect of mechanisms such as the transport of pollutants from the bulk of the liquid to the catalyst surface and the transport phenomena inside the porous film. Experimental results of the effects of film thickness on the observed reaction rate for both liquid-side and support-side illumination are here compared with the predictions of a one-dimensional mathematical model of the porous photocatalytic slab. Good agreement was observed between the experimentally obtained photodegradation of phenol and its by-products, and the corresponding model predictions. The results have confirmed that an optimal catalyst thickness exists and, for the films employed here, is 5\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm. Furthermore, the modelling results have highlighted the fact that porosity, together with the intrinsic reaction kinetics are the parameters controlling the photocatalytic activity of the film. The former by influencing transport phenomena and light absorption characteristics, the latter by naturally dictating the rate of reaction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSonochemically enhanced Wurtz coupling using lithium metal has been investigated for a number of isomeric alkyl bromides under a variety conditions. The products result from direct coupling of short lived radicals formed at the metal surface rather than the secondary radicals which can be formed during coupling of aromatic halides and thus give rise to a single major product. Coupling has been extended to dibrominated aryl and alkyl compounds as well as showing that aryl\u2013alkyl coupling is possible. Dibrominated alkyls were found to give low molecular weight oligomers although no reaction occurred for 1,2-isomers. The growth of oligomers in THF may be solubility limited. A simple model is proposed to explain these findings.",

    "abstract": "Measured hole diffusion coefficients in dye monolayers are larger than can be explained by a charge hopping model with a static distribution of parameters describing intermolecular hole transfer. We show that large amplitude fluctuations of the tethered dye configurations on the surface could explain the observed diffusion rates by enabling charges trapped in particular configurations to escape as the dye orientation changes. We present a multiscale model of hole transport that includes the effect of dynamic rearrangement of the monolayer of anchored dyes. Conformations of pairs of indolene dye molecules (both D102 and D149) were generated by a rigid molecular packing algorithm and Car\u2013Parrinello molecular dynamics to mimic the conformational and configurational disorder of a dye monolayer adsorbed to an anatase (101) titanium dioxide surface. The electronic coupling (Jij) for each pair of neighboring dyes was calculated to build distributions representing the disorder in a real system. These values were used as inputs to Marcus\u2019 non-adiabatic equation for charge transfer to calculate the rate of hole hopping for each pair. Hole diffusion was simulated with a continuous time random walk, accounting for different time scales of molecular rearrangement (changes in the dye geometry). The dynamic nature of configurational disorder was captured by reassigning the values of Jij, drawn from the aforementioned distributions, after a fixed renewal time. We found hole diffusion coefficients of 3.3 \u00d7 10\u20138 and 9.2 \u00d7 10\u20138 cm2 s\u20131 for D102 and D149, respectively, for a renewal time of 10\u20137 s. This is in good agreement with the corresponding measured coefficients for D102 and D149 of 9.6 \u00d7 10\u20138 and 2.5 \u00d7 10\u20137 cm2 s\u20131, whereas the diffusion coefficients are underestimated by at least a factor of 15 if the dynamics are ignored. Fast rearrangement of dye monolayer configuration may explain the high lateral hole diffusion coefficients determined experimentally. Our results indicate that both chemical structure and the availability of different packing configurations must be considered when designing conductive molecular monolayers.",

Both products are crystalline materials, and structure determination by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction revealed that both are essentially one-dimensional metal\u2013organic polymers with -M-SC6H4S- repeat units. Diffuse reflectance UV\u2013visible spectroscopy indicates band gaps of 2.89 eV for [Hg(SC6H4S)(en)]n and 2.54 eV for [Pb(SC6H4S)(dien)]n, while density functional theory (DFT) band structure calculations yielded band gaps of 2.24 and 2.10 eV, respectively. The two compounds are both infinite polymers of metal atoms linked by 1,4-benzenedithiolate, the prototypical molecule for single-molecule conductivity studies, yet neither compound has significant electrical conductivity as a pressed pellet. In the case of [Pb(SC6H4S)(dien)]n calculations indicate fairly flat bands and therefore low carrier mobilities, while the conduction band of [Hg(SC6H4S)(en)]n does have moderate dispersion and a calculated electron effective mass of 0.29\u00b7me. Hybridization of the empty Hg 6s orbital with SC6H4S orbitals in the conduction band leads to the band dispersion, and suggests that similar hybrid materials with smaller band gaps will be good semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPathogenic bacteria secrete various virulence factors, including toxins, lipases and proteases that allow them to infect, breakdown and colonize host tissue. Among various modes of action that the pathogenic bacteria use to damage the host, pore formation (by pore forming toxins (PFTs)) and lipid hydrolysis (by phospholipases) modes are common in damaging the eukaryotic cell membrane. PFTs in their monomeric form are extracellular diffusible and able to form hydrophilic pores in cell membrane while phospholipases cleaves and hydrolyzes the ester bonds of most phospholipids in cell membrane. Both modes of action cause uncontrolled permeation of ions and molecules across cell membrane, leading to cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. In this work, the toxins secreted by two clinically important human pathogens, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA476) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) were studied via their interaction with a planar tethered bilayer lipid membrane (pTBLM) using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Detection and discrimination is based on lipid-loss (lipid hydrolysis by phospholipases) or non lipid-loss (pore formation by PFTs) from pTBLM upon interaction with supernatant of pathogenic bacteria. Using EIS and SPR, it is demonstrated that major toxins of S. auerus are PFTs while most of toxin associated with P. aeruginosa are more lipid damaging lipolytic enzymes. Such a format might have future utility as a simple assay for measuring the presence membrane lytic virulence factors in clinical samples.",

The selected model reaction was performed over a 4\u00a0wt.% palladium/alumina catalyst using 30% (v/v) isopropanol/water solvent. Liquid and gas superficial velocities were varied over a wide range (0.0098\u00a0<\u00a0VSG\u00a0<\u00a00.0356\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121 and 0.0074\u00a0<\u00a0VSL\u00a0<\u00a00.1485\u00a0m\u00a0s\u22121) in order to study the effect of gas bubble and liquid slug lengths on the observed reaction rate and selectivity towards cis-2-butene-1,4-diol. At constant VSG, upon increasing VSL the reaction rate was sensitive to liquid slug length (LS) and flow pattern such that the maximum reaction rate occurred at LS/D\u00a0=\u00a01.2. While at constant VSL, upon increasing VSG the reaction rate was influenced by both gas (LG) and liquid slug lengths, decreasing from 0.0012\u00a0mol\u00a0l\u22121\u00a0min\u22121 to reach a steady value. Varying the liquid slug length caused the selectivity to increase from 20 to 88%, whilst varying the gas slug length had a smaller effect, whereupon the selectivity slightly decreased from 95 to 83.6%.

The model complex [Ir(cod)(IiPr)(OH)] (IiPr=1,3-(diisopropyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) undergoes reaction with a wide variety of substrates including boronic acids and silicon compounds. In addition, OH, NH and CH bond activation was achieved with alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and various sp-, sp2- and sp3-hybridised carbon centres, giving access to a wide range of new IrI complexes. These studies have allowed us to explore the exciting reactivity of this motif, revealing a versatile and useful synthon capable of activating important chemical bonds under mild (typically room temperature) conditions. No additives were required and, in the case of XH bond activation, water was the only waste product, rendering this an atom efficient procedure for bond activation. This system has great potential for the construction of new catalytic cycles for organic synthesis and small-molecule activation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPathogenic bacteria secrete various virulence factors that can directly interact with the outer lipid bilayer membrane of eukaryotic cells, inducing cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. Such virulence factors account for much of the toxic action associated with bacterial infection; therefore the detection of such proteins could provide a methodology for sensing/detection of pathogenic bacteria in, for example, food or human tissue. Detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria by conventional methods such as plating and counting in laboratory is expensive and time consuming. With growing concerns over emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic bacteria with high resistant to current antibiotics, there is a potential need for effective detection of pathogenic toxins in-vitro. This paper presents the application of tethered bilayer lipid membrane (TBLM) as a sensing platform for the detection of the clinically relevant pathogenic bacterial, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA 476 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 via their secreted virulence factors, using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A non-pathogenic strain of bacteria, E. coli DH5\u00ce\u00b1 was used as a control. A clear difference in the impedance of the TBLM for the pathogenic vs. non-pathogenic species was observed.",

    "abstract": "A new family of fluorosulfates has attracted considerable attention as alternative positive electrode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. However, an atomic-scale understanding of the ion conduction paths in these systems is still lacking, and this is important for developing strategies for optimization of the electrochemical properties. Here, the alkali-ion transport behavior of both LiFeSO4F and NaFeSO4F are investigated by atomistic modeling methods. Activation energies for numerous ion migration paths through the complex structures are calculated. The results indicate that LiFeSO4F is effectively a three-dimensional (3D) lithium-ion conductor with an activation energy of \u223c0.4 eV for long-range diffusion, which involve a combination of zigzag paths through [100], [010], and [111] tunnels in the open tavorite lattice. In contrast, for the related NaFeSO4F, only one direction ([101]) is found to have a relatively low activation energy (0.6 eV). This leads to a diffusion coefficient that is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than any other direction, suggesting that NaFeSO4F is a one-dimensional (1D) Na-ion conductor.Keywords:  Li-ion battery; lithium iron fluorosulfate; sodium iron fluorosulfate; atomistic modeling; ion transport; lithium ion conductor; sodium ion conductor",

Olivine NaMPO4 (M = Fe, Fe0.5Mn0.5, Mn) and layered Na2FePO4F are interesting materials that have been reported recently as attractive positive electrodes. Here, we report their Na-ion conduction behavior and intrinsic defect properties using atomistic simulation methods. In the olivines, Na ion migration is essentially restricted to the [010] direction along a curved trajectory, similar to that of LiMPO4, but with a lower migration energy (0.3 eV). However, Na/M antisite defects are also predicted to have a lower formation energy: the higher probability of tunnel occupation with a relatively immobile M2+ cation \u2013 along with a greater volume change on redox cycling \u2013 contributes to the poor electrochemical performance of the Na-olivine. Na+ ion conduction in Na2FePO4F is predicted to be two-dimensional (2D) in the interlayer plane with a similar low activation energy. The antisite formation energy is slightly higher; furthermore, antisite occupation would not be predicted to impede transport significantly owing to the 2D pathway. This factor, along with the much lower volume change on redox cycling, is undoubtedly responsible for the better electrochemical performance of the layered structure. Where volume change and structural effects do not incur impediments, Na-ion materials may present significant advantages over their Li counterparts.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " For sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing the choice of the metal film and the strategy to bind the receptors to the SPR chip is critical. We have shown recently (Touahir, L.; Niedziolka-Jonsson, J.; Galpin, E.; Boukherroub, R.; Gouget-Laemmel, A. C.; Solomon, I.; Petukhov, M.; Chazalviel, J.-N.; Ozanam, F.; Szunerits, S. Langmuir 2010, 26, 6058) that a 5 nm thick layer of an amorphous silicon\u2212carbon alloy (a-Si1\u2212xCx:H) deposited on a silver-based SPR interface can significantly enhance the sensitivity. In addition, the capping of a surface-plasmon active silver layer with a thin film of hydrogenated amorphous silicon\u2212carbon alloy provides a practical solution for obtaining chemically stable SPR interfaces usable in conditions typical of bioassays with the additional advantage of benefiting from well-controlled processes for a robust covalent immobilization of biological probes to the interface. In this paper we demonstrate that the developed architecture in conjugation with an optimized surface functionalization scheme allows for a highly sensitive analysis of interfacial DNA\u2212DNA binding interactions using surface plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (SPFS) as detection principle. The influence of the density of surface linked DNA probes on the recognition of 50 nM cDNA strands is presented. On an optimized surface (15% of acid-anchoring groups) DNA complementary probes with concentrations of 500 fM could be detected making this approach interesting compared to classical SPR experiments where nanomolar (nM) detection limits are conventionally reached.",

Reaction of the proligands [H3(Ln)] (n = 1\u20134) with iron(III) chloride in the presence of base (triethylamine) and 1-methylimidazole (1-Meim) as co-ligand led to the formation of iron complexes of the type [Fe(Ln)(1-Meim)] (n = 1\u20134) (1\u20134) respectively, while treatment of the trilithium salt of [H3(L5)] with iron(III) chloride afforded [Fe(L5)] (5).

Binding interactions within these supramolecular complexes were investigated in the solid state by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and probed in solution by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The systematic modulation of the porphyrin \u03c0-density was achieved, for the first time as multiple methoxy and fluorine groups were introduced as substituents to the 5,15-diaryls of the porphyrin. For these, the variation of the porphyrin\u2013NDI binding strengths determined by 1H NMR titrations was shown, using the Swain's type dual parameter approach, to be closely linked with the peripheral substitution pattern of the diaryl porphyrins validated by crystallography. The new 1:1 donor\u2013acceptor complexes formed display characteristic features of the aromatic-stacked systems, i.e. the parallel arrangement and short interplanar separation between the substituted porphyrin and NDI. Synthetic modification of electron-density on the porphyrin surface by introducing substituents at peripheral sites of functionalised porphyrins represent a general solution towards electronically tunable aromatic surfaces: an understanding of their solution and solid state behaviour will significantly improve the rational design of new functional donor\u2013acceptor supramolecular materials with potential applications ranging from new energy materials to dye-sensitised solar cells, photovoltaics and future drug delivery devices.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Despite the progress of recent experimental works in exploiting this to enhance the material\u2019s performance in important technological systems such as Li-ion batteries the detailed atomic-scale mechanisms still require explanation. The ability of surfaces and interfaces to produce intriguing phenomena including superconductivity and magnetism has been firmly established by intensive research in recent years. In this work we use density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that key surfaces of rutile MnO2 possess electronically conducting surface states, in contrast to the insulating bulk material. The surface band structure demonstrates that the conducting states are associated with both surface manganese and oxygen sites. Furthermore, the metallic conductivity is found to be anisotropic for the (001) surface, which may be exploited in device applications. The implications for the energy storage capacity and catalytic activity of rutile MnO2 are discussed in light of the need for good electron transport in Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and Li\u2013O2 batteries.",

However, a thorough understanding of its atomic-scale surface properties is lacking, which we address here using density functional theory (DFT). A Wulff construction based upon relaxed surface energies demonstrates that the equilibrium morphology expresses the low index (100), (110) and (111) surfaces as well as the high index (211) and (112) surfaces. The predicted morphology exhibits clear elongation along the c-axis which is consistent with the large number of nanorod type structures that are obtainable experimentally. The surface structures expressed in the morphology are discussed in detail and it is found that \u03b1-MnO2 gives rise to larger surface relaxations than are observed for the less open rutile structured MnO2. Enhanced magnetic moments at surface sites are rationalised by a crystal field argument. Experimental studies consistently find that \u03b1-MnO2 has higher catalytic activity than other polymorphs of MnO2. In this work, calculated formation energies for oxygen vacancy defects at the expressed surfaces are demonstrably lower, by \u223c1 eV, than for rutile MnO2 surfaces [Tompsett et al., JACS, 2014, 136, 1418]. The lowest vacancy formation energy occurs at the (112) surface, which despite its relative high Miller index constitutes 17% of the surface area of the calculated morphology. This may play a key role in the favourable catalytic performance observed for \u03b1-MnO2 in a broad range of applications.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Motivated by this we have investigated the stability and electronic structure of rutile (\u03b2-)MnO2 surfaces using density functional theory. A Wulff construction from relaxed surface energies indicates a rod-like equilibrium morphology that is elongated along the c-axis, and is consistent with the large number of nanowire-type structures that are obtainable experimentally. The (110) surface dominates the crystallite surface area. Moreover, higher index surfaces than considered in previous work, for instance the (211) and (311) surfaces, are also expressed to cap the rod-like morphology. Broken coordinations at the surface result in enhanced magnetic moments at Mn sites that may play a role in catalytic activity. The calculated formation energies of oxygen vacancy defects and Mn reduction at key surfaces indicate facile formation at surfaces expressed in the equilibrium morphology. The formation energies are considerably lower than for comparable structures such as rutile TiO2 and are likely to be important to the high catalytic activity of rutile MnO2.",

    "abstract": "MnO2 is attracting considerable interest in the context of rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and Li\u2013O2 battery applications. This work investigates the electrochemical properties of hollandite \u03b1-MnO2 using density functional theory with Hubbard U corrections (DFT+U). The favorable insertion sites for Li-ion and Na-ion insertion are determined, and we find good agreement with measured experimental voltages. By explicit calculation of the phonons we suggest multiple insertion sites are accessible in the dilute limit. Significant structural changes in \u03b1-(Li,Na)xMnO2 during ion insertion are demonstrated by determining the low energy structures. The significant distortions to the unit cell and Mn coordination are likely to be active in causing the observed degradation of \u03b1-MnO2 with cycling. The presence of Li2O in the structure reduces these distortions significantly and is the probable cause for the good experimental cycling stability of \u03b1-[0.143Li2O]-MnO2. However, the presence of Na2O is less effective in reducing the distortion of the Na-ion intercalated form. We also find a distinct change in the favored Li-ion insertion site, not identified in previous studies, for lithiation of \u03b1-LixMnO2 at x > 0.5. The migration barriers for both Li-ions and Na-ions increase from <0.3 eV in the dilute limit to >0.48 eV for \u03b1-(Li,Na)0.75MnO2. Finally, the electronic density of states in \u03b1-MnO2 with the incorporation of Li2O has the character of a full metal, not a half metal as was suggested in previous work.

In this work density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the phonon instabilities as a function of chemical and hydrostatic pressure show that the primary lattice instabilities in ${\\text{Sr}}_{3}$${\\text{Ir}}_{4}$${\\text{Sn}}_{13}$ lie at phonon modes of wave vectors $\\mathbf{q}=(0.5,0,0)$ and $\\mathbf{q}=(0.5,0.5,0)$.

However, the application of chemical pressure to form ${\\text{Ca}}_{3}$${\\text{Ir}}_{4}$${\\text{Sn}}_{13}$ reduces the energetic advantage of these instabilities, which is completely removed by the application of a hydrostatic pressure of 35 kbar to ${\\text{Ca}}_{3}$${\\text{Ir}}_{4}$${\\text{Sn}}_{13}$. The evolution of these lattice instabilities is consistent with the experimental phase diagram. The structural distortion associated with the mode at $\\mathbf{q}=(0.5,0.5,0)$ produces a distorted cell with the same space-group symmetry as the experimentally refined low-temperature structure. Furthermore, calculation of the deformation potential due to these modes quantitatively demonstrates a strong electron-phonon coupling. Therefore, these modes are likely to be implicated in the structural transition and superconductivity of this system.",

The electrochemical behavior of nanostructured mesoporous \u03b2-MnO2 is in sharp constrast to the bulk crystalline system, which can intercalate little or no lithium; this is not fully understood on the atomic scale. Here, the electrochemical properties of \u03b2-MnO2 are investigated using density functional theory with Hubbard U corrections (DFT+U). We find good agreement between the measured experimental voltage, 3.0 V, and our calculated value of 3.2 V. We consider the pathways for lithium migration and find a small barrier of 0.17 eV for bulk \u03b2-MnO2, which is likely to contribute to its good performance as a lithium intercalation cathode in the mesoporous form. However, by explicit calculation of surface to bulk ion migration, we find a higher barrier of >0.6 eV for lithium insertion at the (101) surface that dominates the equilibrium morphology. This is likely to limit the practical use of bulk samples, and demonstrates the quantitative importance of surface to bulk ion migration in Li ion cathodes and supercapacitors. On the basis of the calculation of the electrostatic potential near the surface, we propose an efficient method to screen systems for the importance of surface migration effects. Such insight is valuable for the future optimization of manganese oxide nanomaterials for energy storage devices.Keywords:  lithium battery; surface; supercapacitor; DFT; cathode; manganese oxides",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne of the uses of ultrasound in dentistry is in the field of endodontics (i.e. root canal treatment) in order to enhance cleaning efficiency during the treatment. The acoustic pressures generated by the oscillation of files in narrow channels has been calculated using the COMSOL simulation package. Acoustic pressures in excess of the cavitation threshold can be generated and higher values were found in narrower channels. This parallels experimental observations of sonochemiluminescence. The effect of varying the channel width and length and the dimensions and shape of the file are reported. As well as explaining experimental observations, the work provides a basis for the further development and optimisation of the design of endosonic files.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe sonochemical acceleration of bleaching of Rhodamine B by sodium hypochlorite has been studied using ultrasound intensities in the range 0\u20137\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122. Using a 20\u00a0kHz ultrasonic horn, it was shown that ultrasound could significantly shorten the treatment time and/or the concentration of hypochlorite required for the reaction. A number of intermediate species formed during the reaction have been identified. It was demonstrated that the same sonochemical reactions occur during the use of dental ultrasound instruments of the type used in endodontics where hypochlorite solutions act as disinfectants. Results showed pseudo-first order degradation kinetics for the degradation of Rhodamine B for both types of source. Both the distribution of cavitation and the resulting bleaching reactions were dependent on the design of the tips. The bleaching reaction can therefore be used to characterise the behaviour of dental instruments and aid in the optimisation of their performance.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound has been widely used for cleaning purposes in a variety of situations, including in dental practice. Cleaning is achieved through a combination of acoustically driven streaming effects and sonochemical effects arising from the production of inertial cavitation in a liquid. In our work, various dental instruments used for endodontic (root canal) treatment have been evaluated for their efficiency in producing sonochemical effects in an in-vitro cleaning environment. The areas where cavitation was produced were mapped by monitoring chemiluminescence from luminol solutions and this was correlated with their cleaning efficiencies - assessed by the ability to bleach a dye, to form an emulsion by mixing immiscible components and also to remove ink from a glass surface. The results showed good correlation (Pearson's coefficient > 0.9) between the cavitation and cleaning efficiencies, suggesting that the former plays an important role in cleaning. The methods developed and the results will be beneficial in endodontics research in order to optimise future root canal instruments and treatments.",

Furthermore, observed isotope-effects in the extracted lattice parameters and atomic positions illustrate the importance of investigating compounds in their natural hydrogenous form whenever possible.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Chlorella vulgaris biofilms were grown in the millimetre sized pores of the ceramic electrodes, producing an extensive extra cellular matrix that was anchored directly to the electrode surface. In contrast algal cells grown on carbon felt appeared misshapen and lacked a continuous extra cellular matrix. A preliminary comparison of different anodes in p-MFCs showed that the power density was \u223c16 times higher on a ceramic anode compared to the best performing carbon anode. Good power densities were also found for algae grown directly onto FTO coated glass, but in contrast to the ceramic anodes the biofilm did not adhere strongly to the planar surface and was easily removed or damaged.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

In this study we have used rotating disk electrochemistry (RDE) to investigate the reduction of ferricyanide by the model organism Chlorella vulgaris. Importantly, we have seen that the diffusion limited current due to the oxidation of ferrocyanide, [Fe(CN)6]4\u2212, at the electrode decreased linearly as C. vulgaris was added to the solution, even though in a pure ferrocyanide solution the algae are not able to reduce the mediator further and are simply spectator \u2018particles\u2019. We attribute this effect to trapping of ferrocyanide at the cell surface, with up to 14% of the ferrocyanide missing from the solution at the highest cell concentration. The result has important implications for all techniques that use electrochemistry and other concentration dependent assays (e.g. fluorescence and colourimetry) to monitor ferrocyanide concentrations in the presence of both biofilms and cell suspensions. Analyte trapping could lead to a substantial underestimation of the concentration of reduced product.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Deuteration of accessible cellulose chains followed by WANS showed that these chains were packed at similar spacings to crystalline cellulose, consistent with their inclusion in the microfibril dimensions and with a location at the surface of the microfibrils. Using the Scherrer equation and correcting for considerable lateral disorder, the microfibril dimensions of cherry, birch and sunflower microfibrils perpendicular to the [200] crystal plane were estimated as 3.0, 3.4 and 3.3\u00a0nm respectively. The lateral dimensions in other directions were more difficult to correct for disorder but appeared to be 3\u00a0nm or less. However for cherry and sunflower, the microfibril spacing estimated by SANS was about 4\u00a0nm and was insensitive to the presence of moisture. If the microfibril width was 3\u00a0nm as estimated by WAXS, the SANS spacing suggests that a non-cellulosic polymer segment might in places separate the aggregated cellulose microfibrils.",

    "abstract": "Organometallic iridium complexes bearing oxidatively stable chelate ligands are precursors for efficient homogeneous water-oxidation catalysts (WOCs), but their activity in oxygen evolution has so far been studied almost exclusively with sacrificial chemical oxidants. In this report, we study the electrochemical activation of Cp*Ir complexes and demonstrate true electrode-driven water oxidation catalyzed by a homogeneous iridium species in solution. Whereas the Cp* precursors exhibit no measurable O2-evolution activity, the molecular species formed after their oxidative activation are highly active homogeneous WOCs, capable of electrode-driven O2 evolution with high Faradaic efficiency. We have ruled out the formation of heterogeneous iridium oxides, either as colloids in solution or as deposits on the surface of the electrode, and found indication that the conversion of the precursor to the active molecular species occurs by a similar process whether carried out by chemical or electrochemical methods. This work makes these WOCs more practical for application in photoelectrochemical dyads for light-driven water splitting.",

The nuclear density obtained from the neutron diffraction data shows an asymmetric position of the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen bond which is invariant as a function of temperature.

The two polymorphs are fully characterised by single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction and quantum mechanical calculations. There is evidence of structured crystal growth defects in both polymorphic crystals via observation of diffuse scattering and a disorder model for the average structure of Form I, which can be interpreted as a mixing of the two dimer conformations.

    "abstract": "4-Phenoxyphenol is a simple organic molecule that crystallizes as a porous material with channels running throughout the structure. The channels are constructed by a 6-fold hydrogen bonded ring and can host solvent molecules incorporated during crystal growth, with a minimum channel diameter of 5.8\u20135.9 \u00c5; each channel usually contains a single solvent molecule per unit cell. The hydrogen bonded ring shows surprising flexibility, being able both to breathe and to sustain its crystalline integrity even when grown with empty pores. This is particularly surprising given that the remainder of the interactions within the crystal structure are C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions and are weak in nature. It is also possible to grow \u201cdry\u201d porous 4-phenoxyphenol crystals by using a bulky solvent in the recrystallization.",

Single crystal neutron diffraction under varying temperature (30\u2013295 K) and pressure (ambient-4 kbar) confirmed the crystallographically-constrained symmetric disposition of the hydrogen atom in the short, strong hydrogen bond for each of eight sets of (p,T) conditions. Plane-wave DFT calculations show the hydrogen atom still to occupy this symmetric position even when crystallographic symmetry is removed, in stark contrast to the results from isolated molecule ab initio calculations. These results demonstrate that the symmetric (or close to symmetric) nature of this hydrogen bond is intrinsic.",

The strong, detailed and very distinctive diffraction patterns can be accounted for almost entirely on the assumption of random occupancy of each molecular site, but with very large local relaxation displacements that tend to increase the neighbouring distances for contacts involving NO2NO2 and NO2Cl with a corresponding reduction for those involving ClCl.

    "abstract": "Many strong biological materials exist in the form of fibres that are partially crystalline but contain a substantial proportion of disordered domains, which contribute to the mechanical performance but result in broadening of the reflections in the diffraction patterns of such materials and make structure determination difficult. Where multiple forms of disorder are simultaneously present, many of the accepted ways of modelling the influence of disorder on a fibre diffraction pattern are inapplicable. Lateral disorder in cellulose fibrils of flax fibres was characterized by a multi-step approach. First, a scattering component derived from domains less uniformly oriented than the rest was isolated. A second scattering component giving rise to asymmetry in the radial profiles of the equatorial reflections was then quantified and subtracted. This component was associated with domains that could be related to the crystalline cellulose lattice, but with more variable and, on average, wider equatorial d spacings. A further partially oriented component with highly disordered lateral d spacings unrelated to any of the cellulose lattice dimensions was identified. This component may be derived from non-cellulosic polysaccharides. The remaining broadening was then separated into a contribution from disorder within the crystalline lattice, including known disorder in hydrogen bonding, and a Scherrer contribution from the microfibril diameter. The methods described are likely to find applications in the study of both natural and synthetic polymer fibres in which mechanical properties are influenced by disorder.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe analysis of sewage for urinary biomarkers of illicit drugs is a promising and complementary approach for estimating the use of these substances in the general population. For the first time, this approach was simultaneously applied in 19 European cities, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a 1-week period. An inter-laboratory comparison study was performed to evaluate the analytical performance of the participating laboratories. Raw 24-hour composite sewage samples were collected from 19 European cities during a single week in March 2011 and analyzed for the urinary biomarkers of cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, methamphetamine and cannabis using in-house optimized and validated analytical methods. The load of each substance used in each city was back-calculated from the measured concentrations. The data show distinct temporal and spatial patterns in drug use across Europe. Cocaine use was higher in Western and Central Europe and lower in Northern and Eastern Europe. The extrapolated total daily use of cocaine in Europe during the study period was equivalent to 356\u00a0kg/day. High per capita ecstasy loads were observed in Dutch cities, as well as in Antwerp and London. In general, cocaine and ecstasy loads were significantly elevated during the weekend compared to weekdays. Per-capita loads of methamphetamine were highest in Helsinki and Turku, Oslo and Budweis, while the per capita loads of cannabis were similar throughout Europe. This study shows that a standardized analysis for illicit drug urinary biomarkers in sewage can be applied to estimate and compare the use of these substances at local and international scales. This approach has the potential to deliver important information on drug markets (supply indicator).",

Nineteen types of vesicle were made with varying compositions of phosphocholine (PC), phosphoethanolamine (PE), cholesterol and the photo-polymerizable ampiphile 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid (TCDA). The selectivity of the vesicles was measured via a simple fluorescence \u201cswitch on\u201d assay. Sensitivity of the vesicles to 40 clinically derived strains of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was also demonstrated.

    "abstract": "AbstractWe have prepared novel [\u00ce\u00b74] and [\u00ce\u00b75]+ tricarbonyliron complexes from an unusual enantiopure cyclohexadiene ligand that possesses a quaternary stereocentre; this in turn is prepared through biotransformation of an aromatic ring. The cyclohexadiene ligand initially possessed two hydroxyl groups, both of which could be substituted with other functionality by means of an overall [\u00ce\u00b74]\u00a0\u2192\u00a0[\u00ce\u00b75]+\u00a0\u2192\u00a0[\u00ce\u00b74]\u00a0\u2192\u00a0[\u00ce\u00b75]+\u00a0\u2192\u00a0[\u00ce\u00b74] sequence. From six novel tricarbonyliron complexes which have been prepared, three have been characterised by x-ray crystallography. The reaction sequence we describe is potentially of relevance to the synthesis of analogues of the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir. In addition, the failure of an attempted addition of a bulky nitrogen nucleophile to an [\u00ce\u00b75]+ complex sheds light on the limits of reactivity for such additions. Thus, two bulky nucleophiles which are each known to add successfully to unencumbered [\u00ce\u00b75]+ complexes seemingly cannot be added sequentially to adjacent positions on the cyclohexadiene ligand.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCantharidin (1) and norcantharidin (2) are potent protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors that also display high levels of anticancer activity against a broad range of tumor cells lines. Surprisingly, \u00ce\u0094-5,6-ethyl norcantharidin (3, cis-tetrahydrofurano[3,4-c]furan-1,3-dione) displays neither phosphatase inhibition nor anticancer activity. This suggests that the 5,6-ethyl bridge is pivotal to both anti-cancer and protein phosphatase activity. Additionally bioisosteric replacement of the ethereal oxygen has no effect on biological activity nor does modification of the anhydride moiety. Unlike the parent norcantharidin, anhydride ring opening has no effect on either protein phosphatase inhibition or anti-cancer activity. Additionally, this work highlights the discovery of the octyl substituted, cis-5-benzyl-2-hexyltetrahydro-2H,3aH-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,3-dione, 9p, and the octyl substituted, cis-octyltetrahydro-5H-furo[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, 8p, as two new cytotoxic agents which are equipotent (9p) with, and more potent (8p) than norcantharidin.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound was employed to synthesize poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [poly(NIPAM)] either as aqueous solutions or microgels in the absence of a chemical initiator. Poly(NIPAM) of different microstructures can be readily prepared via ultrasound irradiation by varying the reaction temperature. At a preparation temperature of 20 \u00b0C, poly(NIPAM) was formed in aqueous solutions, whereas, at a higher preparation temperature (beyond the lower critical solution temperature of approximately 32 \u00b0C), poly(NIPAM) microgels were formed. In addition, the high shear gradients generated by the acoustic cavitation process aid to control or vary the molecular weights of poly(NIPAM) formed in aqueous solutions. The swelling behavior of poly(NIPAM) at different concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was also studied. An increase in the transition temperature and hydrodynamic size of the particles was attributed to SDS binding to the polymer network through hydrophobic interactions. Light scattering data reflected the formation of larger microgels at low cross-linker concentrations. The encapsulation of rhodamine B within the microgels was achieved by sonicating the monomer containing the dye. The subsequent release of the dye was consistent with Fickian diffusion and the diffusion coefficient of the dye was estimated as 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 and 3.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 m2 s\u22121 at 20 and 40 \u00b0C, respectively. From the diffusion coefficients, the viscosities of the polymer samples at 20 and 40 \u00b0C were determined using the Stokes\u2212Einstein equation to be 77 and 10 cP, respectively.",

Of the three different types of liposomes with variable lipid chain lengths that were chosen, the degree of polymerization had a significant impact on the long-term stability, and response, to external microbial exotoxins secreted by pathogenic bacteria, namely, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

This tutorial review highlights the use of amidine, guanidine, and related isothiourea catalysts in organic synthesis, as well as the evidence for the nucleophilic nature of these catalysts. The most common application of these catalysts to date has been in acyl transfer reactions, although the application of these catalysts towards other reactions is an increasing area of interest. In this respect, amidine and guanidine derived catalysts have been shown to be effective in catalysing aldol reactions, Morita\u2013Baylis\u2013Hillman reactions, conjugate additions, carbonylations, methylations, silylations, and brominations.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

However, efficient means of separating and depolymerising the components are required. An ionic liquid mixture containing the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation and a mixture of alkylbenzenesulfonates with xylenesulfonate as the main anion was used to extract lignin from sugarcane plant waste at atmospheric pressure and elevated temperatures (170\u2013190 \u00b0C). The lignin was recovered from the ionic liquid by precipitation, allowing the ionic liquid to be recycled. An extraction yield exceeding 93% was attained. The lignin produced had a molecular weight of 2220 g/mol after acetylation. The regenerated ionic liquid showed good retention of structure and properties. The other product of the extraction was a cellulose pulp, which can be used in further processing.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

After adsorption of myoglobin the voltammetric signal corresponding to redox reaction of heme prosthetic group is observed. This electrode exhibits bioelectrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide reduction with cathodic current linearly dependent on concentration in millimolar range. After adsorption of glucose oxidase the electrode exhibits well defined voltammetric signal attributed to the electrochemical reaction of redox cofactor FAD. In oxygenated solution the cathodic current decreases and is linearly dependent on glucose concentration in the millimolar range. In the presence of mediator \u2013 ferrocene carboxylate, bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of glucose is seen. The magnitude of the redox voltammetric signal of both enzymes is roughly proportional to the amount of nanoparticulate material.",

As shown by scanning electron and atomic force microscopies, the nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the electrode surface forming small aggregates of tens of nanometers in size. The mediator-free electrode exhibits significant and pH-dependent electrocatalytic activity towards dioxygen reduction. The maximum catalytic current density (95\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcA\u00a0cm\u22122) is obtained at pH 4.8 corresponding to maximum activity of the enzyme. Under these conditions dioxygen electroreduction commences at 0.575\u00a0V vs. Ag|AgClsat, a value close to the formal potential of the T1 redox centre of the laccase. The scanning electrochemical microscopy images obtained in redox competition mode exploiting mediatorless electrocatalysis show that the laccase is evenly distributed in the composite film.

The high flexibility of many metal\u2013organic systems introduces a strong temperature dependence of the magnetic exchange interactions owing to changes in the crystal structure. Here, we study the cobalt adipate system, for which anisotropic thermal expansion was recently shown to be a result of magnetoelastic coupling. The combination of density functional theory with quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics is shown to be a powerful tool for describing temperature dependent thermodynamic potentials that determine magnetic interactions. It is demonstrated that the effect of phonons can be sufficient to switch the preference for ferromagnetic versus antiferromagnetic ordering.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThree dimensional carbon film electrodes were prepared from oppositely charged carbon nanoparticles (ca. 9 to 18\u00a0nm diameter) by a layer-by-layer approach. This was done by alternative immersion of indium tin oxide plates into suspension of positively and negatively charged particles. A stable film is formed already after single immersion and withdrawal step as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Up to ten immersion and withdrawal steps can be used to systematically increase the amount of nanoparticulate carbon material. The capacitive current density and current density of hydrogen peroxide reduction are proportional to the number of immersion and withdrawal steps. The same can be seen for adsorbed redox active 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate). After adsorption of bilirubin oxidase into the film efficient bioelectrocatalytic dioxygen reduction is observed.",

The composite materials were characterized by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and UV\u2013vis/fluorescence spectroscopy. The strong fluorescence of the BA probes is quenched in the presence of GO through fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The BA@GO composite sensors formed provide a useful platform for fluorogenic detection of monosaccharides based on the strong affinity between the boronic acid receptor and monosaccharides. The BA@GO composite sensor displayed a \u201cturn-on\u201d fluorescence response with a good linear relationship toward fructose over a range of other saccharides.Keywords:  graphene oxide; boronic acid; monosaccharide; fluorescence sensing; nanocomposite; fructose",

Bromination of 5-nitroisoquinolin-1-one gave 4-bromo-5-nitroisoquinolin-1-one but neither this nor 5-amino-4-bromoisoquinolin-1-one would participate in Pd-catalysed couplings. Protection of the lactam as 1-methoxy- and 1-benzyloxy-4-bromo-5-nitroisoquinolines, however, permitted Stille, Suzuki and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig couplings to take place in high yields, insensitive to electronic demands and severe steric bulk in the arylboronic acids. Lithiation of 4-bromo-1-methoxy-5-nitroisoquinoline and quench with iodomethane gave 1-methoxy-4-methyl-5-nitroisoquinoline in low yield. Demethylation of the 1-methoxy-4-substituted-5-nitroisoquinolines with hydrogen bromide gave 4-substituted-5-nitroisoquinolin-1-ones, whereas hydrogenolytic debenzylation was achieved with simultaneous reduction of the 5-nitro group. 5-Amino-4-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)isoquinolin-1-one was identified as a new potent and selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-2 (PARP-2).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The enhanced fluorescence of the probe when bound with D-fructose was switched off in the presence of peroxynitrite. In contrast, other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) led to only slight fluorescence decreases due to protection by an internal N\u2013B interaction. The interaction of the probe with D-fructose not only strengthens the fluorescence signal, but also protects the boronic acid from oxidation by other ROS/RNS. Therefore, under conditions generating various ROS/RNS, the boronate-based saccharide complex preferentially reacts with peroxynitrite. The probe was used in cell imaging experiments for the detection of endogenous and exogenous peroxynitrite. The sensor displays good \u201con\u2013off\u201d responses towards peroxynitrite, both in RAW 264.7 cells and HeLa cells.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Phenylboronic acid (PBA), benzoboroxole (BBA) and 2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)phenylboronic acid (NBA) were employed to bind with ARS to form the complex probes. In particular, the ARS\u2013NBA system with a high binding affinity can preferably react with peroxynitrite over hydrogen peroxide and other ROS/RNS due to the protection of the boron via the solvent-insertion B\u2013N interaction. Our simple system produces a visible colorimetric change and on\u2013off fluorescence response towards peroxynitrite. By coupling a chemical reaction that leads to an indicator displacement, we have developed a new sensing strategy, referred to herein as RIA (Reaction-based Indicator displacement Assay).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Two series of isoquinolin-1-ones were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as selective inhibitors of PARP-2, using the structures of the catalytic sites of the isoforms. A new efficient synthesis of 5-aminoisoquinolin-1-one was developed, and acylation with acyl chlorides gave 5-acylaminoisoquinolin-1-ones. By examination of isoquinolin-1-ones with carboxylates tethered to the 5-position, Heck coupling of 5-iodoisoquinolin-1-one furnished the 5-CH\u2550CHCO2H compound for reduction to the 5-propanoic acid. Alkylation of 5-aminoisoquinolin-1-one under mildly basic conditions, followed by hydrolysis, gave 5-(carboxymethylamino)isoquinolin-1-one, whereas it was alkylated at 2-N with methyl propenoate and strong base. Compounds were assayed in vitro for inhibition of PARP-1 and PARP-2, using FlashPlate and solution-phase assays, respectively. The 5-benzamidoisoquinolin-1-ones were more selective for inhibition of PARP-2, whereas the 5-(\u03c9-carboxyalkyl)isoquinolin-1-ones were less so. 5-Benzamidoisoquinolin-1-one is the most PARP-2-selective compound (IC50(PARP-1)/IC50(PARP-2) = 9.3) to date, in a comparative study.",

It was shown that most boronic acids can moderately inhibit the enzyme activity and, in particular, the inhibitory effects of (3-formylphenyl)boronic acid and (3-carboxyphenyl)boronic acid (9% and 12%, respectively) are comparable to that reported for the binary L-serine-plus-borate inhibition system (7%). Furthermore, it was shown that the addition of physiologically nontoxic saccharides is very effective in regenerating the enzyme activity. This effect is attributed to the competitive binding of saccharides with the boronic acid inhibitor to pull it out into the water phase. Thus, this paper offers a novel methodology for inhibition and control of \u03b3-GTP activity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA peptide-like self-immolative molecular clip is required for release of active drugs from prodrugs by endopeptidases. Upon cleavage from the carrier, this clip must collapse and release the drug rapidly. A series of aminoacyl-5,5-dimethylthiaproline (Aaa-Dmt) N-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)amides were designed. Boc-l-aminoacyl fluorides were coupled with R-DmtOH to give Boc-l-Aaa-R-DmtOH, which were converted to the Boc-l-Aaa-R-Dmt N-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)amides. The l,S diastereomeric series was prepared by the reaction of Boc-Aaa PFP esters with S-DmtOH. The l-Aaa-Dmt N-(2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl)amides were allowed to cyclise to diketopiperazines (DKPs) in aqueous buffers, expelling 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamine as a model for amine-containing drugs. Reaction rates were dependant\u00a0on pH. In the l,R diastereomeric series, increasing steric bulk of the Aaa side-chain (Gly, Ala, Phe, Val) led to decrease in the reaction rate. However, in the l,S series, the greatest rate of reaction was observed for the most bulky amino-acid (Val), with t\u00bd=15\u00a0min at pH 8.0. The effects of steric bulk and stereochemistry are rationalised through conformational analysis (NMR and X-ray crystallography) of the starting dipeptide amides, the product diketopiperazines and key analogues. Since the dipeptides are (almost) exclusively in the cis-amide conformation, trans\u2013cis interconversion is not relevant. The data suggest that steric interactions in the reacting conformations of the dipeptide amides, as they form the tetrahedral intermediates, are the controlling factors. Thus, l-Aaa-S-Dmt amides are shown to be excellent candidates for incorporation into the design of novel prodrugs.",

The high defect energies suggest that significant intrinsic disorder (either Frenkel, Schottky or reduction) in BaZrO3 is unlikely, which is consistent with the relative chemical stability of this system. In contrast, favourable redox processes are found for intrinsic reduction of BaPrO3, and oxidation of acceptor-doped BaPrO3, the latter leading to p-type conduction properties as observed experimentally. Binding energies for dopant-OH pairs in BaZrO3 indicate the weakest association for Gd and Y dopants, and the strongest association for Sc. The high binding energies for all the dopant-OH pair clusters in BaPrO3 suggest strong proton trapping effects, which would be detrimental to proton conductivity. The water incorporation or hydration energy is found to be less exothermic for BaZrO3 than for BaPrO3, the higher exothermic value for the latter suggesting that water incorporation extends to higher temperatures in accord with the available thermodynamic data. The energies and pathways for oxide ion migration in both materials are also investigated.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic stem (ES) cell fate. To gain further insight into the mechanisms regulated by PI3Ks in murine ES cells, we have performed expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChips to characterize the transcriptional changes that arise as a result of inhibition of PI3K-dependent signaling. Using filtering of greater than 1.5-fold change in expression and an analysis of variance significance level of p < .05, we have defined a dataset comprising 646 probe sets that detect changes in transcript expression (469 down and 177 up) on inhibition of PI3Ks. Changes in expression of selected genes have been validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology analyses reveal significant over-representation of transcriptional regulators within our dataset. In addition, several known regulators of ES cell pluripotency, for example, Nanog, Esrrb, Tbx3, and Tcl-1, are among the downregulated genes. To evaluate the functional involvement of selected genes in regulation of ES cell self-renewal, we have used short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown. These studies identify genes not previously associated with control of ES cell fate that are involved in regulating ES cell pluripotency, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1 and the Zscan4 family of zinc finger proteins. Further gain-of-function analyses demonstrate the importance of Zscan4c in regulation of ES cell pluripotency. STEM CELLS 2009;27:764\u2013775",

High quality interatomic potentials with a proven track record for simulation of surface and bulk properties, including a representation of electronic polarizability were deployed. The calculations generally predict a free energy barrier to aggregation. However, the free energy barrier to aggregation can be removed by allowing the particles to approach in a crystallographically aligned manner. This implies that aggregation may not be an energetic imperative, but can occur as the result of fluctuations in orientation. Lowering of nanoparticle energy by change in orientation may drive crystal growth via oriented aggregation.",

However, as direct experimental measurements probing the metal oxide\u2212water interface of nanoparticles are not easily performed, we use atomistic simulations using experimentally derived potential parameters to determine the structure and dynamics of the interface between magnesium oxide nanoparticles and water. We use a simple strategy to generate mineral nanoparticles, which can be applied to any shape, size, or composition. Molecular dynamics simulations were then used to examine the structure of water around the nanoparticles, and highly ordered layers of water were found at the interface. The structure of water is strongly influenced by the crystal structure and morphology of the mineral and the extent of hydroxylation of the surface. Comparison of the structure and dynamics of water around the nanoparticles with their two-dimensional flat surface counterparts revealed that the size, shape, and surface composition also affects properties such as water residence times and coordination number.",

    "abstract": "High resolution X-ray diffraction data on forms I\u2013IV of sulfathiazole and neutron diffraction data on forms II\u2013IV have been collected at 100 K and analyzed using the Atoms in Molecules topological approach. The molecular thermal motion as judged by the anisotropic displacement parameters (adp\u2019s) is very similar in all four forms. The adp of the thiazole sulfur atom had the greatest amplitude perpendicular to the five-membered ring, and analysis of the temperature dependence of the adps indicates that this is due to genuine thermal motion rather than a concealed disorder. A minor disorder (\u223c1\u20132%) is evident for forms I and II, but a statistical analysis reveals no deleterious effect on the derived multipole populations. The topological analysis reveals an intramolecular S\u2013O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interaction, which is consistently present in all experimental topologies. Analysis of the gas-phase conformation of the molecule indicates two low-energy theoretical conformers, one of which possesses the same intramolecular S\u2013O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interaction observed in the experimental studies and the other an S\u2013O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H\u2013N intermolecular interaction. These two interactions appear responsible for \u201clocking\u201d the molecular conformation. The lattice energies of the various polymorphs computed from the experimental multipole populations are highly dependent on the exact refinement model. They are similar in magnitude to theoretically derived lattice energies, but the relatively high estimated errors mean that this method is insufficiently accurate to allow a definitive stability order for the sulfathiazole polymorphs at 0 K to be determined.",

A trajectory initiated for the wild-type enzyme\u2013substrate complex with the proximal xylose ring bound at the \u20131 subsite (adjacent to the scissile glycosidic bond) in the 4C1 chair conformation shows spontaneous transformation to the 2,5B boat conformation, and potential of mean force calculations indicate that the boat is \u223c30 kJ mol\u22121 lower in free energy than the chair. Analogous simulations for the mutant lacking one oxygen atom confirm the key role of Tyr69 in stabilizing the boat in preference to the 4C1 chair conformation, with a relative free energy difference of about 20 kJ mol\u22121, by donating a hydrogen bond to the endocyclic oxygen of the proximal xylose ring. QM/MM MD simulations for phenyl \u03b2-xyloside in water, with and without a propionate/propionic acid pair to mimic the catalytic glutamate/glutamic acid pair of the enzyme, show the 4C1 chair to be stable, although a hydrogen bond between the OH group at C2 of xylose and the propionate moiety seems to provide some stabilization for the 2,5B conformation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "We perform a systematic comparison of the finite-temperature structure and properties of four bulk semiconductors(PbS, PbTe, ZnS, and ZnTe) predicted by eight popular exchange-correlation functionals from quasi-harmonic lattice-dynamics calculations. The performance of the functionals in reproducing the temperature dependence of a number of material properties, including lattice parameters, thermal-expansion coefficients, bulk moduli, heat capacities, and phonon frequencies, is evaluated quantitatively against available experimental data. We find that the phenomenological over- and under-binding characteristics of the local-density approximation and the PW91 and Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) generalised-gradient approximation (GGA) functionals, respectively, are exaggerated at finite temperature, whereas the PBEsol GGA shows good general performance across all four systems. The Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) and revTPSS meta-GGAs provide relatively small improvements over PBE, with the latter being better suited to calculating structural and dynamical properties, but both are considerably more computationally demanding than the simpler GGAs. The dispersion-corrected PBE-D2 and PBE-D3 functionals perform well in describing the lattice dynamics of the zincchalcogenides, whereas the leadchalcogenides appear to be challenging for these functionals. These findings show that quasi-harmonic calculations with a suitable functional can predict finite-temperature structure and properties with useful accuracy, and that this technique can serve as a means of evaluating the performance of new functionals in the future.",

However, the study of molecular processes, in particular those related to electronic excitations (e.g. photochemistry), frequently pushes quantum-chemical techniques to their limit. The disparity in the level of theory accessible to periodic and molecular calculations presents a significant challenge when modelling molecular crystals, since accurate calculations require a high level of theory to describe the molecular species, but must also take into account the influence of the crystalline environment on their properties. In this article, we briefly review the different classes of quantum-chemical techniques, and present an overview of methods that account for environmental influences with varying levels of approximation. Using a combination of solid-state and molecular calculations, we quantitatively evaluate the performance of implicit-solvent models for the [Ni(Et4dien)(\u03b72-O,ON)(\u03b71-NO2)] linkage-isomer system as a test case. We focus particularly on the accurate reproduction of the energetics of the isomerisation, and on predicting spectroscopic properties to compare with experimental results. This work illustrates how the synergy between periodic and molecular calculations can be exploited for the study of molecular crystals, and forms a basis for the investigation of more challenging phenomena, such as excited-state dynamics, and for further methodological developments.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Two-dimensional potential-of-mean-force calculations based upon molecular dynamics with the AM1/OPLS method for wild-type BCX with a p-nitrophenyl xylobioside substrate in water clearly indicates a stepwise mechanism for glycosylation: the rate-determining step is nucleophilic substitution by Glu78 to form the covalently bonded enzyme-substrate intermediate without protonation of the leaving group by Glu172. The geometrical configuration of the transition state for the enzymic reaction is essentially the same as found for a gas-phase model involving only the substrate and a propionate/propionic acid pair to represent the catalytic glutamate/glutamic acid groups. In addition to stabilizing the 2,5B boat conformation of the proximal xylose in the non-covalent reactant complex of the substrate with BCX, Tyr69 lowers the free-energy barrier for glycosylation by 42 kJ mol\u22121 relative to that calculated for the Y69F mutant, which lacks the oxygen atom OY. B3LYP/6-31+G* energy corrections reduce the absolute height of the barrier to reaction. In the oxacarbenium ion-like transition state OY approaches closer to the endocyclic oxygen Oring of the sugar ring but donates its hydrogen bond not to Oring but rather to the nucleophilic oxygen of Glu78. Comparison of the average atomic charge distributions for the wild-type and mutant indicates that charge separation along the bond between the anomeric carbon and Oring is matched in the former by a complementary separation of charge along the OY\u2013HY bond, corresponding to a pair of roughly antiparallel bond dipoles, which is not present in the latter.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

To identify genetic loci for obesity susceptibility, we examined associations between body mass index and ~2.8 million SNPs in up to 123,865 individuals with targeted follow up of 42 SNPs in up to 125,931 additional individuals. We confirmed 14 known obesity susceptibility loci and identified 18 new loci associated with body mass index (P < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128), one of which includes a copy number variant near GPRC5B. Some loci (at MC4R, POMC, SH2B1 and BDNF) map near key hypothalamic regulators of energy balance, and one of these loci is near GIPR, an incretin receptor. Furthermore, genes in other newly associated loci may provide new insights into human body weight regulation.",

    "abstract": "The extraordinary thermoelectric properties of lead chalcogenides have attracted huge interest in part due to their unexpected low thermal conductivity. Here, it is shown that anharmonicity and large cation disorder are present in both PbTe and PbS, based on elaborate charge density visualization using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SPXRD) data analyzed with the maximum entropy method (MEM). In both systems, the cation disorder increases with increasing temperature, whereas the Te/S anions appear to be centered on the expected lattice positions. Even at the lowest temperatures of 105 K, the lead ion is on average displaced by \u22480.2 \u00c5 from the rock-salt lattice position, creating a strong phonon scattering mechanism. These findings provide a clue to understanding the excellent thermoelectric performance of crystals with atomic disorder. The SPXRD\u2013MEM approach can be applied in general opening up for widespread characterization of subtle structural features in crystals with unusual properties.",

    "abstract": "The lead chalcogenides represent an important family of functional materials, in particular due to the benchmark high-temperature thermoelectric performance of PbTe. A number of recent investigations, experimental and theoretical, have aimed to gather insight into their unique lattice dynamics and electronic structure. However, the majority of first-principles modeling has been performed at fixed temperatures, and there has been no comprehensive and systematic computational study of the effect of temperature on the material properties. We report a comparative lattice-dynamics study of the temperature dependence of the properties of PbS, PbSe, and PbTe, focusing particularly on those relevant to thermoelectric performance, viz. phonon frequencies, lattice thermal conductivity, and electronic band structure. Calculations are performed within the quasiharmonic approximation, with the inclusion of phonon-phonon interactions from many-body perturbation theory, which are used to compute phonon lifetimes and predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The results are critically compared against experimental data and other calculations, and add insight to ongoing research on the PbX compounds in relation to the off-centering of Pb at high temperatures, which is shown to be related to phonon softening. The agreement with experiment suggests that this method could serve as a straightforward, powerful, and generally applicable means of investigating the temperature dependence of material properties from first principles.",

    "abstract": "The physical behaviour and device performance of phase-change, non-volatile memory materials can often be improved by the incorporation of small amounts of dopant atoms. In certain cases, new functionality can also be introduced, for example a contrast in magnetic properties between amorphous and crystalline phases of the host phase-change material when certain transition-metal dopants are included. This Chapter reviews some of the experimental data relating to doped phase-change materials and, in particular, a survey is given of the role played by molecular-dynamics simulations in understanding the atomistic mechanisms involved in the doping process. In addition, some examples are given of the in silico discovery of new phase-change compositions resulting from ab initio molecular-dynamics (AIMD) simulations.",

    "abstract": "The optical, electrochemical and density functional theory molecular simulation of a metal-free D-(\u03c0-A)2, i.e., 3,3\u2032-(5,5\u2032-(9-hexyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) denoted as D has been investigated. A stepwise cosensitization of D with N719 dye is adopted to enhance the power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells.             The metal-free dye possesses strong absorption in the 370\u2013450\u00a0nm wavelength range and effectively overcomes the competitive light absorption by I                                                                  3                              \u2212                            /I                                    \u2212. The N719/D cosensitized dye-sensitized solar cell shows a power conversion efficiency of about 7.24\u00a0%, which is higher than the dye-sensitized solar cells based on either N719 (5.78\u00a0%) or D (3.95\u00a0%) sensitizers. The improved power conversion efficiency of the cosensitized dye-sensitized solar cell is attributed to the combined enhancement of both short-circuit photocurrent and open-circuit voltage. The short-circuit photocurrent improvement is attributed to the increase in the both light-harvesting efficiency of the cosensitized photoanode and charge collection efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cell. However, the open-circuit voltage is improved due to better adsorption and surface coverage of TiO2 on cosensitization and an associated reduction in the back electron recombination with increased electron lifetime. These effects are analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and dark current\u2013voltage measurements of the dye-sensitized solar cells.",

The molecular structure of the metal complex trans-[Pt(p-tolyl3P)2(C\u2261CC6H4\u2013p-NO2)2] (1) was confirmed by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The electronic absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the metal complexes and polymers have been used to probe their photophysical properties. The studies reveal that the presence of heavy metal atom and substituent groups on the phenyl ring of the ligands can enhance the efficiency of intersystem crossing from the S1 singlet excited state to the T1 triplet excited state and thus give intense phosphorescence.",

The halide exchange of Br- by I- can be easily performed, giving rise to compounds of the type [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5)(Im)I]. The new complexes [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5) (tBu2Im)Br] (1), [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5)(Me4Im)Br] (2), [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5)(Me2Im)Br] (3), [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5)(Me2Im)I] (4), and [Ni(\u03b73-C3H5)(Me4Im)I] (5) were obtained in good yields and were fully characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray crystal structures of 1, 2, 4, and 5 reveal a square-planar geometry at the nickel atom and a tilt angle of the NHC ring (in relation to the Ni square plane) dependent on the bulkiness of both the N substituents and the halogen bound to Ni. Variable-temperature NMR experiments in solution show that compounds 1\u22125 are stereochemically nonrigid. Three simultaneous dynamic processes are observed with increasing temperature:\u2009 (a) NHC rotation about the nickel\u2212carbon bond, starting at lower temperatures (\u0394G\u29e7 = 14\u221218 kcal mol-1 for compounds 2\u22125), (b) allyl rotation about the Ni\u2212\u03b73-allyl axis, which is responsible for the cis\u2212trans isomerization observed at intermediate temperatures (\u0394G\u29e7 = 16.4 kcal mol-1 for compound 4), and (c) \u03c0\u2212\u03c3\u2212\u03c0 allyl isomerization, occurring at higher temperatures. DFT calculations were performed in order to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved and suggest (1) NHC rotation is mainly controlled by steric factors imposed by the N-substituent groups and to a lesser extent by the halogen and (2) there is a \u201cspin-forbidden\u201d mechanism for \u03b73-allyl rotation, involving spin singlet and triplet species. Thermodynamic activation parameters obtained by DFT agree well with the experimental values.  ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe decoloration of reactive dye C.I. Reactive Blue 19 (RB 19) using combined ultrasound with the Fenton process has been investigated. The effect of varying the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and iron sulfate, initial pH, ultrasonic power, initial dye concentration and dissolved gas on the decoloration and degradation efficiencies was measured. Calibration of the ultrasound systems was performed using calorimetric measurements and oxidative species monitoring using the Fricke dosimeter and degradations were carried out with a 20\u00a0kHz probe type transducer at 2, 4, 6 and 8\u00a0W\u00a0cm\u22122 of acoustic intensity at 15, 25, 50 and 75\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 initial dye concentrations. First order rate kinetics was observed. It was found that while the degradation rate due to ultrasound alone was slow, sonication significantly accelerated the Fenton reaction. While the results were similar to those reported for other dyes, the effects occurred at lower concentrations. The rate and extent of decoloration of RB 19 increased with rising hydrogen peroxide concentration, ultrasonic powers and iron sulfate concentration but decreased with increasing dye concentration. An optimum pH value of pH\u00a0=\u00a03.5 was found. The rate of decoloration was higher when dissolved oxygen was present as compared with nitrogen and argon confirming the solution phase mechanism of the degradation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe accuracy of pore size distributions (PSD) obtained from gas adsorption and cryoporometry is compromised by the presence of advanced adsorption and advanced melting effects, respectively. In order to improve PSD accuracy, it is necessary to know the extent of such effects. In this work cryoporometry and adsorption have been combined to study the onset of advanced melting effects in a sample partially-saturated with different volumes of condensate, in turn, by pre-equilibration with different vapour pressures of adsorbate. NMR relaxometry and diffusometry have been used to independently study the size and connectivity of adsorbed liquid ganglia at different molten fractions. It has been found that the onset of significant advanced melting coincided with abrupt changes in levels of individual pore-filling and ganglia inter-connections determined by NMR. These findings also highlighted where significant advanced adsorption processes were occurring, where larger pores were being filled with condensate before smaller pores. These studies have enabled the critical pores governing the advanced processes to be identified, and the likely errors in PSDs arising from advanced effects to be quantified.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe conventional data analysis methods for obtaining a pore size distribution (PSD) from gas sorption data make several critical assumptions that impact significantly on the accuracy of the PSD thereby obtained. In particular, assumptions must be made concerning the nature of the pore-filling or emptying process in adsorption, or desorption, respectively. The possibility of pore\u2013pore interactions is also generally neglected. In this work, NMR cryoporometry and relaxometry have been used to study the adsorption and desorption of cyclohexane within a mesoporous, sol\u2013gel silica catalyst support pellet with the aim of assessing the impact of the aforementioned problems for gas sorption PSDs and developing solutions. The advanced melting effect makes cryoporometry a particularly sensitive probe of adsorbate ganglia spatial distribution. It has been demonstrated that utilising gas sorption scanning curves provided insufficient additional information to alleviate the aforementioned problems with interpreting gas sorption data. The NMR data has shown how the nature of the sorption hysteresis changed with amount adsorbed, due to detectable variations in the mechanisms of pore-filling and emptying along the isotherm. Hence, relating a particular condensation or evaporation pressure to a specific characteristic pore size is not as straightforward as assumed in typical pore size analysis software. However, the NMR techniques reveal the additional information required to improve pore size estimates from gas sorption for disordered solids.",

The optical absorption spectrum of CuCrO2 shows a direct allowed absorption onset at 3.18\u2009eV together with a weak peak at 2.0\u2009eV which is suppressed by Sn doping. This suggests that the low energy peak should be attributed to 3d\u21923d excitations associated with Cu2+ defect states rather than excitations localised on Cr3+.

    "abstract": "Experimental excess isotherms for the adsorption of gases in porous solids may be represented by mathematical models that incorporate the total amount of gas within a pore, a quantity which cannot easily be found experimentally but which is important for calculations for many applications, including adsorptive storage. A model that is currently used for hydrogen adsorption in porous solids has been improved to include a more realistic density profile of the gas within the pore, and allows calculation of the total amount of adsorbent. A comparison has been made between different Type I isotherm equations embedded in the model, by examining the quality of the fits to hydrogen isotherms for six different nanoporous materials. A new Type I isotherm equation which has not previously been reported in the literature, the Unilan-b equation, has been derived and has also been included in this comparison study. These results indicate that while some Type I isotherm equations fit certain types of materials better than others, the T\u03ccth equation produces the best overall quality of fit and also provides realistic parameter values when used to analyse hydrogen sorption data for a model carbon adsorbent.",

Here we describe how a molecular iridium catalyst for \u200bwater oxidation directly and robustly binds to oxide surfaces without the need for any external stimulus or additional linking groups. On conductive electrode surfaces, this heterogenized molecular catalyst oxidizes \u200bwater with low overpotential, high turnover frequency and minimal degradation. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show that it does not decompose into \u200biridium oxide, thus preserving its molecular identity, and that it is capable of sustaining high activity towards \u200bwater oxidation with stability comparable to state-of-the-art bulk metal oxide catalysts.",

AFM analysis suggests a growth in thickness of ca. 4\u00a0nm per layer. Stable and strongly adhering films are formed with thickness-dependent coloration. Electrochemical measurements in aqueous H2SO4 confirm the presence of two prominent redox waves consistent with polaron and bipolaron formation processes in the polyaniline\u2013nanocellulose composite. Measurements with a polyaniline\u2013nanocellulose film applied across an ITO junction (a 700\u00a0nm gap produced by ion beam milling) suggest a jump in electrical conductivity at ca. 0.2\u00a0V vs. SCE and a propagation rate (or percolation speed) two orders of magnitude slower compared to that observed in pure polyaniline This effect allows tuning of the propagation rate based on the nanostructure architecture.

The use of homogeneous Cu(OAc)2 (1\u20132\u00a0mol\u00a0%) was found to be effective for this transformation at 80\u00a0\u00b0C. The reaction was successful with either conventional or microwave heating. CuO and CuO/ZnO on activated carbon provided a competent reuseable heterogeneous catalyst which could be used in a batch process or in flow. Copper salts are much cheaper than the precious metals previously used for this rearrangement, and the reaction conditions are milder than those reported.",

X-ray crystallographic studies of 1\u20134 are presented. The structures of 1 and 2 adopt extended motifs by virtue of P\u2013OH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\u2550P-type hydrogen bonding interactions. The molecular structure of 3 is composed of a dimer formed by bridging hydrogen phosphonate groups, while the sulfonate group appended on each tin atom acts in a \u03bc2-bridging mode to afford the formation of one-dimensional coordination polymer featuring alternate eight-membered [\u2212Sn\u2013O\u2013P\u2013O\u2212]2 and [\u2212Sn\u2013O\u2013S\u2013O\u2212]2 rings. The asymmetric unit of 4 is composed of two crystallographically unique trinuclear tin phosphonate clusters with a Sn3(\u03bc3-PO3)2 core linked together by coordinative association of a \u03bc2-sulfonate group, while the remaining sulfonates are involved in the construction of a two-dimensional self-assembly. The identity of 1\u20135 in solution was established by IR and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 31P, 119Sn) NMR spectroscopy. The presence of silaalkyl group in 5 imparts unusual solubility in hydrocarbon, aromatic, and ether solvents.

    "abstract": "The rational design of high-performance fluorescent materials for cancer targeting in vivo is still challenging. A unique molecular design strategy is presented that involves tailoring aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active organic molecules to realize preferable far-red and NIR fluorescence, well-controlled morphology (from rod-like to spherical), and also tumor-targeted bioimaging. The shape-tailored organic quinoline\u2013malononitrile (QM) nanoprobes are biocompatible and highly desirable for cell-tracking applications. Impressively, the spherical shape of QM-5 nanoaggregates exhibits excellent tumor-targeted bioimaging performance after intravenously injection into mice, but not the rod-like aggregates of QM-2.",

The fluorescence OFF\u2013ON switch is triggered by cleavage of the 2,4-dinitrobenzensulfonyl (DNBS) unit from the fluorophore by thiols. The FRET energy donor (\u03bbabs = 498 nm, \u03bbem = 511 nm) is a parent BODIPY moiety and the energy acceptor is based on 4-hydroxylstyryl BODIPY moiety (\u03bbabs = 568 nm, \u03bbem = 586 nm). The unique C\u2013C linker between the energy donor and acceptor was established using a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. A polyether chain was also introduced into the probe to improve solubility in aqueous solution. While probe 1 itself is non-fluorescent, in the presence of cysteine or homocysteine a red emission at 590 nm is switched on (excitation at 505 nm), producing a pseudo-Stokes shift of up to 77 nm, which is in stark contrast to the small Stokes shift (ca. 10 nm) observed for typical BODIPY dyes. Excitation of the energy donor leads to the red emission from the acceptor of the probe, and demonstrates a high energy transfer efficiency. The probe was used for in vivo fluorescent imaging of cellular thiols. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of the probe and the photophysical properties of the fluorescent intermediates were fully rationalized by DFT calculations. The lack of fluorescence of probe 1 is attributed to the dark excited state S1 (oscillator strength f = 0.0007 for S0 \u2192 S1, based on the optimized S1 state geometry), which is due to the electron sink effect of the DNBS moiety. Cleavage of the DNBS moiety from the fluorophore by thiols re-establishes the emissive S1 state of the fluorophore (f = 1.4317 for S0 \u2192 S1), thus the red emission can be observed in the presence of thiols (fluorescence is turned on). The FRET effect of the probe was rationalized by DFT calculations which indicated that upon excitation into the S4 excited state (localized on the energy donor unit), the S1 state (localized on the energy acceptor, i.e. styryl-BODIPY) is populated via internal conversion (IC), thus red emission from the styryl-BODIPY energy acceptor is observed (Kasha's rule).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

To evaluate the intrinsic sorptive capacity of the clay minerals, the sorption free energies of dioxins at the clay {001} surfaces were calculated, and this showed that the hydrophobicity of the surface is a factor controlling the adsorption. The intercalation of dioxins from the external solvent into the interlayer space of clays was also evaluated, showing the importance of the presence of organic cations. We found that organoclays have sufficient hydrophobicity with large organic cations, and this coupled with the swelling properties of montmorillonite ensures effective adsorption from an aqueous environment. HDTMA-Mont is shown to have these features and that the dioxins were immobilized within the long alkyl chains of the counterions.",

The formation of a methylpropionate functionality on the phosphorus center in these structural frameworks results from in situ esterification of the carboxylic group. X-ray crystallographic studies of 1\u22127 are presented. The structures of 1 and 2 represent one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers composed of alternate [Sn\u2212O]2 and [Sn\u2212O\u2212S\u2212O]2 cyclic rings formed by \u03bc2-alkoxo and sulfonate ligands, respectively. For 3\u22125 and 7, variable bonding modes of phosphonate and/or sulfonate ligands afford the construction of two- and three-dimensional self-assemblies that are comprised of trinuclear tin entities with an Sn3P2O6 core as well as [Sn\u2212O\u2212P-O]2 and/or [Sn\u2212O\u2212S\u2212O]2 rings. The formation of a 1D coordination polymer in 6 is unique in terms of repeating eight-membered cyclic rings containing Sn, O, P, and S heteroatoms. The contribution from hydrogen-bonding interactions is also found to be significant in these structures.",

This same isomeric mixture was formed as the ultimate product from treating Rh(PPh3)3(CO)H with 6-iPr at room temperature, although pathways involving both CO and PPh3 loss were observed at initial times. Treatment of 1a/1b with Et3N\u00b73HF generated the bifluoride complex cis-Rh(6-iPr)(PPh3)2(FHF) (2a), which upon stirring with anhydrous Me4NF was converted to the rhodium fluoride complex cis-Rh(6-iPr)(PPh3)2F (3a). Thermolysis of 1a/1b with C6F6 resulted in C\u2013F bond activation to afford a mixture of 3a and the pentafluorophenyl complex trans-Rh(6-iPr)(PPh3)2(C6F5) (5b).

The experimental spectra are subsequently characterised by density functional calculations, incorporating pre-optimisation by geometric simulation. We find that at a concentration of four ammonia molecules per \u03b1-cage, the ammonia molecule coordinates with extra-framework Na+ cations and gives rise to three structured regions in the INS spectrum. We show that these regions correspond to translational, librational and tilting motions of the ammonia molecule. These results are in agreement structurally with previous studies of ammonia within a zeolite, and thus show that INS is a valid technique for such investigations.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The 1:1 complex was solely obtained from ethanol solutions, while either complex could be grown from aqueous and methanol solution by variation of the initial composition. The crystal structures of the 2:1 complex and a monohydrate of isonicotinamide were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure of the complex were compared with other published carboxylic acid:isonicotinamide molecular complexes, which highlights the robust nature of the acid\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7pyridine and acid\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7amide hydrogen bond, which exist in most cases.

In addition, elemental Na dispersed in such a matrix is also studied (SiGNa). Data treatment and fitting of experimental spectra yields comparison of the nuclear Compton profiles and radial momentum distributions for the proton in both bulk NaH and nanoscale SiGNaH, with resultant proton kinetic energies being in agreement with previous inelastic neutron studies of bulk NaH. Slight differences in proton radial momentum distributions for bulk and nanoscale systems are witnessed and discussed. The technique of stoichiometric-fixing is applied to the backscattering spectra of each system in order to examine changes in the Na profile width, and NCS is shown to be sensitive to the chemical environment change of this heavier nucleus. Examination of the Si and O profile widths in the gel samples also supports this method.",

We applied quantum chemical methods to investigate the electronic spectrum of three different squaraine dyes and of their complexes with fullerene C60 in the gas phase. Based on the excited-state densities, the electronic states were characterized as localized, delocalized and charge transfer, allowing an understanding of the basic photophysics of these compounds. Comparison with experimental data showed that the measured short-circuit voltage is correlated not only to the energy of the charge-transfer state, but also to the energy of the lowest excited state, localized at the squaraine dyes. We discuss whether this may imply a non-Marcus regime for the charge-pair dissociation at the interface.",

The material is prepared by sequential electrodeposition of a metallic precursor stack in the order Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn and subsequent annealing of the stack in an atmosphere containing sulfur. The new precursor is demonstrably more uniform on both macro-and microscopic scales, and this translates to enhanced lateral uniformity of the photoresponse of the CZTS film.

The band gap of the electrodeposited Cu2O films was determined by photoelectrochemical measurements to be around 1.9\u00a0eV irrespective of the applied potentials. The solar cells with a glass/FTO/Cu2O/AZO structure were fabricated by sputtering an AZO film onto the Cu2O film followed by deposition of an Al contact by vacuum evaporation. The highest efficiency of 0.603% was obtained with a Cu2O film deposited at \u22120.6\u00a0V (vs. Ag/AgCl).

Such methodology may be used to speed mediator screening and selection of optimal and greenest reaction conditions prior to preparation, or isolation, of large quantities of mediators.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " Two methods of reduction of V2O5 have been investigated: oxygen vacancy formation and lithium intercalation. The electronic structure, geometry, and energetics of these reduced systems are examined. Oxygen vacancies in bulk \u03b1-V2O5 have been investigated by using gradient-corrected density functional theory (GGA) and density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions in strongly correlated systems (GGA+U). The GGA calculation predicts a delocalized defect electronic state. This disagrees with experimental evidence, which indicates that oxygen vacancies produce a localized reduced vanadium state in the band gap. The DFT+U results for U = 4.0 eV are consistent with available UPS and XPS data, indicating strong localization on the vanadium atoms nearest the vacancy, and showing reduced V(IV) species. Intercalation of Li in V2O5, which has important potential applications in energy storage devices, is also reported at the GGA+U level, using the value of U obtained from the oxygen-deficient calculation, and localized reduction is demonstrated. These results are again in agreement with available UPS data and crystallographic data, indicating good transferability of this value of U among the systems of interest. Calculated lithium intercalation energies for both the \u03b1- and \u03b3-V2O5 phases are reported, and the structure and relative stability of the deintercalated \u03b3-V2O5 phase are also examined.",

The electrochemical properties of the high energy density LixFeF6 (x = 2, 3, 4) materials have been evaluated using a combination of potential-based and DFT computational methods. Voltages of 6.1 V and 3.0 V are found for lithium intercalation from Li2FeF6 to \u03b1-Li3FeF6 and \u03b1-Li3FeF6 to Li4FeF6 respectively. The calculated density of states indicate that Li2FeF6 possesses metallic states that become strongly insulating after lithium intercalation to form \u03b1-Li3FeF6. The large energy gain associated with this metal\u2013insulator transition is likely to contribute to the associated large voltage of 6.1 V. Molecular dynamics simulations of lithium diffusion in \u03b1-Li3FeF6 at typical battery operating temperatures indicate high lithium-ion mobility with low activation barriers. These results suggest the potential for good rate performance of lithium iron fluoride cathode materials.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

To date, however, an understanding of the mechanism underlying this improvement has been lacking. We present a density functional theory analysis of Pd- and Pt-doped CeO2, and demonstrate that the increased OSC is due to a large displacement of the dopant ions from the Ce lattice site. Pd(II)/Pt(II) (in a d8 configuration) moves by \u223c1.2 \u00c5 to adopt a square-planar coordination due to crystal field effects. This leaves three three-coordinate oxygen atoms that are easier to remove, and which are the source of the increased OSC. These results highlight the importance of rationalizing the preferred coordination environments of both dopants and host cations when choosing suitable dopants for next generation catalysts.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

We report a novel electronic structure for the reduced surface, denoted the split vacancy, which is more stable than the previously reported simple vacancy with subsurface CeIII. Analysis of CO adsorption modes highlights the importance of the geometry of the CO molecule when in contact with the surface, with a tilted adsorption mode being most energetically favorable with the formation of a carbonate anion coupled with surface reduction. A new bidentate adsorption mode is observed for NO2 adsorption, accompanied by partial surface oxidation. These novel structures observed on reduction, CO adsorption, and NO2 adsorption are all energetically more stable than the previously reported structures. In all of the systems, it was found that the location of the CeIII ions did not have a strong effect on the energetics, although they were coupled to strong local distortions of the structure.",

In this article we report a density functional theory investigation of CuBO2, examining the geometry and electronic structure using GGA corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA + U) and a hybrid density functional (HSE06). From analysis of the calculated band structure, density of states, and optical absorption, we predict an indirect fundamental band gap of \u223c3.1 eV and a direct optical band gap of \u223c3.6 eV. The hole effective mass at the valence band maximum indicates the potential for good p-type conductivity, consistent with the reported experimental results.

We calculate the electronic structure and defect physics of ${\\mathrm{PbO}}_{2}$, using a hybrid density functional, and show that it is an $n$-type semiconductor with a small indirect band gap of $\\ensuremath{\\sim}0.2\\text{ }\\text{ }\\mathrm{eV}$.

A dipole-forbidden band gap combined with a large carrier induced Moss-Burstein shift results in a large effective optical band gap. The model is supported by neutron diffraction, which reveals that the oxygen sublattice is only 98.4% occupied, thus confirming oxygen substoichiometry as the electron source.",

To date, investigations of the Li-doping process have been confined to the bulk and the (100) surface. In this paper, we describe an investigation of the surface dependence of Li-doping of MgO through an in-depth study of the (100), (110), and (111) low index surfaces using density functional theory with correction for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U). Three competing defect configurations were investigated on each of the surfaces; substitution of Li for Mg with the formation of a compensating oxygen hole state, substitution of Li for Mg with the addition of a Li surface interstitial and the clustering of two Li ions with the formation of a neutral [L      L   ] oxygen vacancy. Our results demonstrate that the energetics associated with the Li-doping of MgO are strongly surface dependent. On the (100) surface, there is an energy cost associated with Li-doping, whereas on the (110) and (111) surfaces Li-doping is energetically favored. The implications of the results for the catalytic activity of the different surface terminations of MgO are discussed.  ",

    "abstract": "Silicalite, a high-silica zeolite with MFI topology, undergoes pressure-induced amorphisation (PIA) when compressed with nonpenetrating pressure media. PIA is prevented by penetrating pressure media. In several zeolites, links have recently been found between pressure-induced phase transitions and the flexibility window, a geometric property of the framework identified by geometric simulation. We have analyzed structural data from compression experiments on silicalite, and we find that PIA occurs while the structure lies within its flexibility window. Penetrating media, which prevent PIA, push the structure outside the flexibility window. Thus framework flexibility is required for PIA to occur in silicalite. This link between amorphisation and flexibility is further evidence of the deep connections between framework geometry, flexibility, and the physical properties of zeolites.",

Conversely, the pristine material can deform near its theoretical strength limit. Specifically, atomistic models of ceria nanorods have been generated with full microstructure, including: growth direction, morphology, surface roughening (steps, edges, corners), point defects, dislocations and grain-boundaries. The models were then used to calculate the mechanical strength as a function of microstructure. Our simulations reveal that the compressive yield strengths of ceria nanorods, ca. 10 nm in diameter and without extended defects, are 46 and 36 GPa for rods oriented along [211] and [110] respectively, which represents almost 10% of the bulk elastic modulus and are associated with yield strains of about 0.09. Tensile yield strengths were calculated to be about 50% lower with associated yield strains of about 0.06. For both nanorods, plastic deformation was found to proceed via slip in the {001} plane with direction \u3008110\u3009 \u2212 a primary slip system for crystals with the fluorite structure. Dislocation evolution for the nanorod oriented along [110] was nucleated via a cerium vacancy present at the surface. A nanorod oriented along [321] and comprising twin-grain boundaries with {111} interfacial planes was calculated to have a yield strength of about 10 GPa (compression and tension) with the grain boundary providing the vehicle for plastic deformation, which slipped in the plane of the grain boundary, with an associated \u3008110\u3009 slip direction. We also predict, using a combination of atomistic simulation and DFT, that rutile-structured ceria is feasible when the crystal is placed under tension. The mechanical properties of nanochains, comprising individual ceria nanoparticles with oriented attachment and generated using simulated self-assembly, were found to be similar to those of the nanorod with grain-boundary. Images of the atom positions during tension and compression are shown, together with animations, revealing the mechanisms underpinning plastic deformation. For the nanochain, our simulations help further our understanding of how a crystallising ice front can be used to \u2018sculpt\u2019 ceria nanoparticles into nanorodsvia oriented attachment.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Today synthetic zeolites are the most important catalysts in petrochemical refineries because of their high internal surface areas and molecular-sieving properties1, 2. There have been considerable efforts to synthesize new zeolites with specific pore geometries3, 4, to add to the 167 available at present. Millions of hypothetical structures have been generated on the basis of energy minimization5, and there is an ongoing search for criteria capable of predicting new zeolite structures. Here we show, by geometric simulation6, 7, 8, that all realizable zeolite framework structures show a flexibility window over a range of densities. We conjecture that this flexibility window is a necessary structural feature that enables zeolite synthesis, and therefore provides a valuable selection criterion when evaluating hypothetical zeolite framework structures as potential synthetic targets. We show that it is a general feature that experimental densities of silica zeolites lie at the low-density edge of this window\u2014as the pores are driven to their maximum volume by Coulomb inflation. This is in contrast to most solids, which have the highest density consistent with the local chemical and geometrical constraints.",

We characterized Na-Y and partially exchanged NH4-Y zeolites by spectroscopic and diffraction methods in order to determine if NH4 exchange itself causes framework modification. High-resolution MAS SS NMR data show that even without calcination, some Al atoms change their local environment from tetrahedral to octahedral. PDF analysis corroborates this change and shows an increase in the aluminium coordination number. TEM images show no significant change in morphology of the crystallites, and no major changes in crystallinity are detected by X-ray diffraction. A similar result is obtained on Na-A zeolite suggesting that such increase in the coordination number of Al atoms during the exchange is a common feature in zeolites. Local probes, NMR and PDF analysis show changes in the local environments of Al atoms in the framework, which are usually not possible to see in the average structure.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "A new approach is presented for modeling perovskite frameworks with disordered Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions and has been applied to study the elastic response of the ${\\mathrm{LaMnO}}_{3}$ structure to defects in the JT ordering. Surprisingly, antiphase domain boundary defects in the pattern of ordered JT octahedra, along the $[110]$ and $[1\\overline{1}0]$ bonding directions, are found to produce 1D stripe patterns rotated 45\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} along ${\\mathbf{a}}^{*}$ directions, similar to stripe structures observed in these systems. Geometric simulation is shown to be an efficient and powerful approach for finding relaxed atomic structures in the presence of disorder in networks of corner-shared JT-distorted octahedra such as the perovskites. Geometric modeling rapidly relaxes large supercells (thousands of octahedra) while preserving the local coordination chemistry, and shows great promise for studying these complex systems.",

However, the chemical environment can change significantly the structure and hence properties of a nanomaterial. Accordingly, its surface reactivity is critically dependent upon the nature of the (biological) environment in which it resides. Here, we use Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and aberration corrected TEM to predict and rationalise differences in structure and hence surface reactivity of ceria nanoparticles in different environments. In particular we calculate reactivity \u2018fingerprints\u2019 for unreduced and reduced ceria nanoparticles immersed in water and in vacuum. Our simulations predict higher activities of ceria nanoparticles, towards oxygen release, when immersed in water because the water quenches the coordinative unsaturation of surface ions. Conversely, in vacuum, surface ions relax into the body of the nanoparticle to relieve coordinative unsaturation, which increases the energy barriers associated with oxygen release. Our simulations also reveal that reduced ceria nanoparticles are more active towards surface oxygen release compared to unreduced nanoceria. In parallel, experiment is used to explore the activities of ceria nanoparticles that have suffered a change in environment. In particular, we compare the ability of ceria nanoparticles, in an aqueous environment, to scavenge superoxide radicals compared to the same batch of nanoparticles, which have first been dried and then rehydrated. The latter show a distinct reduction in activity, which we correlate to a change in the redox chemistry associated with moving between different environments. The reactivity of ceria nanoparticles is therefore not only environment dependent, but is also influenced by the transport pathway or history required to reach the particular environment in which its reactivity is to be exploited.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "A major research theme to emerge in the science and technology of materials is the incorporation of nanostructure into the functionality of properties. Such nanostructured materials can offer distinct advantages over bulk materials, partly because the physical properties of the material itself can vary in a tunable, size-dependent fashion. Of course, in addition, nanoparticles offer a greatly increased surface area for chemical reaction. Typical methods for nanoparticle synthesis include: reaction in the liquid phase using the sol\u2013gel approach and mechanical ball-milling of the bulk material; both of these approaches are somewhat problematic for the preparation of reactive nanostructured materials which are sensitive to air and/or moisture. We report here the formation of crystalline nanoparticles of sodium hydride encapsulated in a host amorphous silica gel matrix. These nanoparticles are formed by in situ hydrogenation of a precursor material\u2014Na loaded silica gel\u2014under mild conditions. The resulting material is considerably less pyrophoric and less air-sensitive than the bulk hydride. We anticipate that this formation method of in situ modification of reactive precursor material may have wide applications.",

The four polymorphic forms are found to exhibit different degrees of hydron transfer.

    "abstract": "Recent experimental work has shown that the width of the intermediate phase varies considerably in chalcogenide glasses containing $\\mathrm{Ge}\u2215\\mathrm{As}\u2215\\mathrm{Se}$. As the chemical composition is varied within a series of glasses, three phases are observed. As the mean coordination of the glass is increased, the floppy phase evolves through the intermediate phase (rigid but unstressed) into the rigid and stressed phase. Here, using an extensive study of computer-generated networks, we show that the intermediate phase is caused by self-organization. This is only possible on networks where the single transition, from the floppy to the rigid and stressed phase, is second order in the absence of self-organization, which leads the network to be responsive to self-organization. This occurs when the structural variability\\char22{}a measure of inhomogeneities within the glasses\\char22{}exceeds a threshold value. The width of the intermediate phase is associated with the local structural variability. Above the threshold value, a large structural variability leads to a wider intermediate phase, which we refer to as the intermediate phase window.",

    "abstract": "Analcime under pressure undergoes a phase transition at ~1.0\u2009GPa from a cubic () form to a low-symmetry triclinic () form. We use geometric simulation to relate the pressure behavior of analcime to a recently discovered property of zeolite frameworks, the \"flexibility window\", defined as the range of densities over which the tetrahedral units in the framework can in principle be made geometrically ideal. Our results show that the range of stability of the cubic phase in analcime is defined by the flexibility window of the cubic framework. Analcime at low density can undergo tetragonal distortion while remaining within the flexibility window, consistent with experimental reports of non-cubic symmetries. On compression to higher densities, the capacity for tetragonal distortion is greatly reduced, accounting for the dramatic reduction in symmetry at the pressure-induced phase transition.",

Such an economy is not sustainable in the medium- to long-term for two fundamental reasons; first, there exists only a finite amount of fossil fuel, and, second, the carbon dioxide released during the combustion of fossil fuels induces anthropogenic climate change with costly and potentially disastrous consequences. Current energy technologies cannot support both a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and an ever-expanding global economy. It is now recognized that hydrogen may be one of the leading contenders as a potential solution for a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, especially for transport and for heat and power generation and energy storage. However, any transition from a carbon-based (fossil fuel) energy system to a hydrogen-based economy involves significant scientific, technological and socio-economic barriers.

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThe quinoline alkaloids from higher plants are best classified according to their biogenetic derivation from either anthranilic acid or tryptophan. A number of simple quinolines, including the parent structure have been isolated from rutaceous plants. Most of these alkaloids are substituted at position 2 of the heterocycle. In addition to the quinolines, angostura bark also contains 1-methyl-2-quinolone. The co-occurrence of 2- and 4-quinolones is a common feature in many plants of the Rutaceae; fortunately spectroscopy allows an easy distinction to be made between these two types of alkaloids. Some thirty alkaloids derived from 9-acridone have been isolated from rutaceous plants; the main structural diversity stems from the substitution of O-methyl, methylenedioxy or O-prenyl functions at the 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-positions. The seeds of several Echinops species (Compositae) contain the alkaloid echinorine. The cinchona alkaloids occur in the bark of Cinchona and Remijia species (Family Rubiaceae), which are indigenous to the eastern tropical slopes of the Andes. Until quite recent times cinchona preparations have been the sole treatment for malaria, for example, Quinine. Pumiliotoxin-C1 is one of the toxic principals of the skin of the highly colored Panamanian frog Dendrobates pumilio.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the deep subgap states in amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO), whether intrinsic to the amorphous structure or not, has serious implications for the development of p-type transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors. We report that the deep subgap feature in a-IGZO originates from local variations in the oxygen coordination and not from oxygen vacancies. This is shown by the positive correlation between oxygen composition and subgap intensity as observed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We also demonstrate that the subgap feature is not intrinsic to the amorphous phase because the deep subgap feature can be removed by low-temperature annealing in a reducing environment. Atomistic calculations of a-IGZO reveal that the subgap state originates from certain oxygen environments associated with the disorder. Specifically, the subgap states originate from oxygen environments with a lower coordination number and/or a larger metal-oxygen separation.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThis chapter focuses on the monocarboxylic acids of the benzene series. The preparation of Benzoic acids from arenes, toluenes, aryl halides, and arynes is discussed. Optimum conditions for the oxidation of alkylarenes to benzoic acids, avoiding decarboxylation, have been determined. Monoalkylbenzenes are oxidized to benzoic acids by oxygen in the presence of a cobalt/manganese catalyst. The oxidation of toluenes (especially nitrotoluenes) with potassium permanganate at 95 \u00baC in nitrobenzene/water under phase-transfer conditions gives good yields of benzoic acids. Another well established approach involves the photochlorination of toluenes, to give benzotrichlorides, followed by hydrolysis. Benzyne can be generated from either bromobenzene, or chlorobenzene, by treatment with sodamide. The aryne is then reacted in situ with O-silyl enolates of carboxylic esters to form bicyclic adducts. These adducts, after hydrolysis, yield 2-alkylbenzoic acids. An improved methodology for the oxidative decarboxylation of toluic acids to cresols using copper salts and cupric oxide has been discussed.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThe Amaryllidaceae alkaloids comprise some one hundred structures isolated from the bulbs of plants from almost all genera of the subfamily Amaryllidoidae. A number of different types of alkaloids are recognized, all of which contain a basic skeleton of fifteen carbon atoms subdivided into a phenylmethyl (C6\u2013C1) unit and a cyclohexylethyl or cyclohexenylethyl (C6-C2) unit, and the majority contain a simple or fused pyrrolidine ring. The best known alkaloid of the Amaryllidaceae is lycorine, the carbon skeleton of which forms the basic framework for a series of natural products. The biosynthetic derivation of the various Amaryllidaceae alkaloids from belladine type precursors suggests that lycorine, crinane and alanthamine alkaloids are derived by the oxidative cyclization of norbelladine derivatives and this hypothesis has been substantiated subsequently by radio-tracer experiments utilizing doubly and triply labeled norbelladines. In this chapter individual alkaloids have been cited as examples. These include pyrrolo[1,2,3-d,e]phenanthridine alkaloids, 2-benzopyrano[3,4-g]indole alkaloids, galanthamine-type alkaloids, [5,10b]-ethanophenanthridine alkaloids, pretazettine-type alkaloids, montanine, coccinine and manthine, and many other miscellaneous alkaloids. Narciprimine and narciclasine, both present in the extracts of the plant Narcissus incomparabilis Mill., are unusual in that their basic skeleton contains only thirteen carbon atoms instead of the usual fifteen.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThis chapter focuses on the five membered monoheterocyclic compounds of the indigo group. The electronic absorption characteristics of many dye molecules containing an unsaturated five-membered ring system is explained in terms of their anti-aromaticity. A one pot synthesis of indigo involves the oxidation of indole with an organic hydroperoxide in the presence of a molybdenum complex. The chapter also reviews the photoisomerism and photochemistry of indigo, its derivatives and related compounds. Indigo is stable to photoinduced trans\u2192cis isomerization, but when the hydrogen atoms of the NH groups are replaced by methyl, or acetyl, functions phototropic mobility is induced. This is explained by loss of hydrogen-bonding to the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl units but a proton-transfer between NH and CO groups in the excited singlet state is also proposed as a pathway for rapid radiationless decay.",

Interest in the derivatives of oxazole was renewed because of their significance in penicillin chemistry. The most familiar example is annnioline, which is obtained from the rye grass Lolium multiflorum. Phenanthroxazoles are synthesized from phenanthrene quinones or better when phenanthrene quinone-imines are heated with primary amines. There are over six hundred patents referring to the application of benzoxazole derivatives as optical brightners and scintillators for cottons and polyesters. Isothiazoles are aromatic in nature, more stable than isoxazoles, and most susceptible to electrophilic attack at C-4. For benzisothiazoles, two structural types are possible depending on which face (c or d) of the heterocycle is fused to the benzene nucleus, benzo[d]isothiazole and benzo[c]isothiazole are more generally known as 1,2-benzisothiazole (or thioindoxazene) and 2,1-benzisothiazole (or thioanthranil), respectively.

Benzotriazoles exist as 1H- or 2H- structures. When unsubstituted at nitrogen the 1H-aromatic isomers are preferred.

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThe indigo group includes, in addition to indigotin and its derivatives, a variety or structurally related compounds, several of which, like the prototype are commercially important vat dyes. They are reducible by virtue of the carbonyl groups to dihydroxy compounds; these form water-soluble salts from solutions of which textile fibers can be impregnated with the reduced or \u201cleuco\u201d compound (generally colorless or much less highly colored than the parent), which is readily oxidized to reproduce the dye deposited in the textile material. The methods that are or have been applied technically to the manufacture of indigo depend for the main part on the production of indoxyl or indoxylic acid (indolin-3-one-2-carboxylic acid) with subsequent oxidation to indigotin by air or an oxidizing agent such as ferric chloride. The various derivatives of indigotin include N-derivatives, derivatives of the carbonyl function, homologs such as 5,5'-dimethylindigo, halogenoindigos, dehydroindigo, leuco-indigo (indigo-white) and polycyclic indigos. The position isomeride, indirubin, is present in small quantities in synthetic indigotin, and in larger and varying amounts in the natural dye; it is unlikely that it contributes significantly to the tinctorial properties of the coloring matter. Isoindigo or isoindigotin, produced by heating 3-diazo-oxindole, is the third possible bisindole indigo.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThis chapter discusses the five-membered heterocyclic compounds with four hetero-atoms in the ring. The compounds of tetrazolesmay be referred to one or other of the tautomeric 1H- or 2H- structures. Tetrazoles require the addition of azides to nitriles. 5-Alkoxy- and 5-aryloxy-tetrazoles are found from the interaction of cyanic esters and azide ion. Tetrazole-5-aldehyde is prepared by the action of hydrazoic acid upon diethoxyacetonitrile. Sulfur containing mesoionic tetrazoles are also known, of which the most commonly encountered is 2,3-diphenyl 2-H-tetrazolium-5-thiolate, often called dehydrodithizone. Nitrosation of the arylhydrazinium dithiocarbamates affords 1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium-5-thiolates, which in the presence of ammonia and ethanol rearrange to 1,2,3,4-thiatriazolium-5-olates. 1,2,3,5-Oxatriazolium salts are synthesized by the diazotization of 2-aminopyridine-l-oxide. 1,2,3,4-Thiatriazoles are compounds with a long and sometimes controversial existence. The usual synthesis of 5-substituted 1,2,3,4-thiatriazoles involves the reaction of thioacylhydrazines with nitrous acid. Thioacylazides are converted directly into 5-alkyl derivatives. In turn the azides are formed as intermediates in the reaction of 1-acetylthio-1-alkynes and ammonium azide. Such compounds are rare, but representative structures can be prepared by addition reactions of nitrile oxides and suitable reagents. 3H-1,2,3,5-oxathiadiazoles are formed and 1,3,2,4-dioxathiazole-2,2-dioxides are produced when sulfur trioxide is used.",

    "abstract": "This chapter describes the application of iridium complexes to catalytic hydrogen transfer reactions. Transfer hydrogenation reactions provide an alternative to direct hydrogenation for the reduction of a range of substrates. A hydrogen donor, typically an alcohol or formic acid, can be used as the source of hydrogen for the reduction of carbonyl compounds, imines, and alkenes. Heteroaromatic compounds and even carbon dioxide have also been reduced by transfer hydrogenation reactions. In the reverse process, the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds can be achieved by iridium-catalyzed hydrogen transfer reactions, where a ketone or alkene is used as a suitable hydrogen acceptor. The reversible nature of many hydrogen transfer processes has been exploited for the racemization of alcohols, where temporary removal of hydrogen generates an achiral ketone intermediate. In addition, there is a growing body of work where temporary removal of hydrogen provides an opportunity for using alcohols as alkylating agents. In this chemistry, an iridium catalyst \u201cborrows\u201d hydrogen from an alcohol to give an aldehyde or ketone intermediate, which can be transformed into either an imine or alkene under the reaction conditions. Return of the hydrogen from the catalyst provides methodology for the formation of amines or C\u2013C bonds where the only by-product is typically water.",

The method of preparation of 6H-1,2-oxazines is discussed. Examples are provided to emphasize the importance of the oxazinium salts as electrophiles; this is supported with schematic structure diagrams. The descriptions of synthesis of oxazines, their use as chiral synthons, and general reactions are also presented. The reduction of 1, 2-oxazines derivative is explained with examples. In certain reactions, the corresponding 1,2-oxazanes seem to be implicated as intermediates in certain reaction types and this is illustrated with an example.",

The structure and reactivity in the case of carbenes is presented and the complex nature of the rearrangements of arylcarbenes is analyzed. A description of the use of frozen organic matrices to study their chemistry is also presented. In addition, the matrix chemistry of arylcarbenes is explained in terms of a thermal singlet-triplet equilibration in which the relative amounts of singlet and triplet chemistry is determined. The chemistry and synthesis of allenes are then reviewed. The syntheses for allenes are done by elimination reactions. The reactions discussed include metalation, photo addition reactions, thermal rearrangements, cycloadditions, and addition reactions. The functionalized allenes presented are silylallenes, allene oxides, hydroxyallenes, silyloxyallenes, acetoxyallenes, and alkoxyallenes. The preparation and cyclization of allenic amides and amines to the corresponding pyrrolidines of piperidines respectively by the action of palladium (II) chloride and cupric chloride are illustrated. Finally, the carbonyl derivatives of allenes, allenic nitriles, allenic sulphones and allenic boronates are discussed.",

In aqueous 1\u00a0M\u00a0NH4F iron metal readily and reversibly electro-deposits onto boron-doped diamond electrodes. The effects of deposition potential, FeF63\u2212 concentration, deposition time, and mass transport are investigated and also the influence of power ultrasound (24\u00a0kHz, 8\u00a0Wcm\u22122). Scanning electron microscopy images of iron nanoparticles grown to typically 20-30 nm diameters are obtained. It is shown that a strongly and permanently adhering film of iron at boron-doped diamond can be formed and transferred into other solution environments. The catalytic reactivity of iron deposits at boron-doped diamond is investigated for the reductive dehalogenation of chloroacetate. The kinetically limited multi-electron reduction of trichloroacetate is dependent on the FeF63\u2212 deposition conditions and the solution composition. It is demonstrated that a stepwise iron-catalysed dechlorination via dichloroacetate and monochloroacetate to acetate is feasible. This sonoelectrochemical methodology offers a novel, clean and very versatile electro-dehalogenation methodology. The role of fluoride in the surface electrochemistry of iron deserves further attention.",

Intrastriatal microinjection of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 induces a chronic reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tissue water, which may be indicative of metabolic failure as established by in vivo models of acute cerebral ischaemia. The OHSC preparation enables examination of the effects of IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 on brain parenchyma per se, independent of the potentially confounding effects encountered in vivo such as perfusion changes, blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and leukocyte recruitment. 31P MRS is a technique that can detect multiple high-energy phosphate metabolites within a sample non-invasively. Here, for the first time, we characterise the energy metabolism of OHSCs using 31P MRS and demonstrate that IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 does not compromise high-energy phosphate metabolism. Thus, the chronic reduction in ADC observed in vivo is unlikely to be a consequence of metabolic failure.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryDerivatives of the two hydrocarbons, anthracene and phenanthrene, C14H10, both containing three condensed benzene rings, are widely distributed in nature, for example, anthraquinone which is found, together with other polycyclic hydrocarbons, in automobile exhaust and thus, it is a minor constituent in the atmospheres of large cities. Anthracene was of commercial value as the primary intermediate for the manufacture of anthraquinone and the extensive range of polycyclic quinone dyestuffs, but anthraquinone is now largely prepared directly from phthalic anhydride and benzene. Industrial applications for phenanthrene are very few. This chapter discusses the methods of formation, synthesis, properties and reactions of anthracenes and its homologs such as alkyl-, aryl-anthracenes, aminoanthracenes, hydroxyanthracenes (anthrols), anthracenecarboxylic acids and their functional derivatives. Of the theoretically possible anthraquinones (anthracenequinones) only the 1,2-, 1,4- and 9,10-isomers are known but hydroxylated derivatives of others exist. A series of hydrocarbons known as bianthryls and their derivatives, are derived from the linkage of two anthryl units. The homologs of phenanthrene include the alkyl-phenanthrenes, aminophenanthrenes or phenanthrylamines, hydroxyphenanthrenes or phenanthrols, formyl- and acyl-phenanthrenes, phenanthrenecarboxylic acids, phenanthrene quinones and biphenanthryls.",

    "abstract": "Computational simulations for chloromethane hydrolysis have been performed using hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical methods with explicit solvation by large numbers of water molecules. In the first part of the paper, we present results for 2\u00b0 2H3, 1\u00b0 14C, and 1\u00b0 37Cl kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) at 298 K with both the AM1/TIP3P and B3LYP/6-31G* QM methods for the nucleophile H2O and electrophile CH3Cl surrounded by 496 solvating TIP3P water molecules. An initial Hessian computed for a subset of this system including up to 104 MM water molecules was reduced in size by successive deletion of rows and columns, and KIEs were evaluated for each. We suggest that accurate calculations of KIEs in solvated systems should involve a subset Hessian including the substrate together with any solvent atoms making specific interactions with any isotopically substituted atom. In the second part of the paper, the ensemble-averaged 2\u00b0 \u03b1-2H3 KIE calculated with the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)/TIP3P method is shown to be in good agreement with experiment. This comparison is meaningful because it includes consideration of uncertainties owing to sampling of a range of representative thermally accessible solvent configurations. We also present ensemble-averaged 14C and 37Cl KIEs which have not as yet been determined experimentally. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The existence of solvent fluctuations leads to populations of reactant-state (RS) and transition-state (TS) configurations and implies that property calculations must include appropriate averaging over distributions of values for individual configurations.

In this way the hybrid AM1/OPLS-AA potential yields \u3008KIE\u3009 values for all six isotopic substitutions (2\u00b0 \u03b1-2H2, 2\u00b0 \u03b2-2H3, \u03b1-11C/14C, leaving group 37Cl, and nucleophile 13C and 15N) for this reaction in the correct direction as measured experimentally. These thermally-averaged calculated KIEs may be compared meaningfully with experiment, and only one of them differs in magnitude from the experimental value by more than one standard deviation from the mean. This success contrasts with previous KIE calculations based upon traditional methods without averaging. The isotopic partition function ratios are best evaluated using all (internal) vibrational and (external) librational frequencies obtained from Hessians determined for subsets of atoms, relaxed to local minima or saddle points, within frozen solvent environments of structures sampled along molecular dynamics trajectories for RS and TS. The current method may perfectly well be implemented with other QM or QM/MM methods, and thus provides a useful tool for investigating KIEs in relation to studies of chemical reaction mechanisms in solution or catalyzed by enzymes.",

    "abstract": " A two-dimensional free-energy surface is constructed for transfer of the methoxymethyl cation between two water molecules. These atoms are treated quantum mechanically within a box of >1000 classical solvent water molecules, and the molecular dynamics of the whole system is considered at 300 K. This provides a simple model for glycosyl transfer in water. The best surface obtained (MPWB1K/6-31+G(d,p) corrected AM1/TIP3P) contains a shallow free-energy well corresponding to an oxacarbenium ion intermediate in a stepwise mechanism. Molecular dynamics analysis at three temperatures leads to a classical estimate of the lifetime of the methoxymethyl cation in water; when quantum corrections for vibrational zero-point energy are included, the lifetime is estimated to be 1 ps. This result is in complete agreement with the best experimental estimate and suggests that computational simulation is a reliable tool for elucidation of glycosyl-transfer mechanisms in enzymes and whether these involve glycosyl cations as intermediates.",

    "abstract": "The enzymeless glucose oxidation process readily occurs on nano-gold electrocatalyst at pH\u20057, but it is highly susceptible to poisoning (competitive binding), for example from protein or chloride. Is it shown here that gold nanoparticle catalyst can be protected against poisoning by a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-EA-TB with BET surface area 1027\u2005m2\u2009g\u22121). This PIM material when protonated, achieves a triple catalyst protection effect by (i) size selective repulsion of larger protein molecules (albumins) and (ii) membrane ion selection effects, and (iii) membrane ion activity effects. PIM materials allow \u201cenvironmental control\u201d to be introduced in electrocatalytic processes.",

    "abstract": "Vacuum carbonization of organic precursors usually causes considerable structural damage and collapse of morphological features. However, for a polymer with intrinsic microporosity (PIM-EA-TB with a Brunauer\u2013Emmet\u2013Teller (BET) surface area of 1027 m2g\u20131), it is shown here that the rigidity of the molecular backbone is retained even during 500 \u00b0C vacuum carbonization, yielding a novel type of microporous heterocarbon (either as powder or as thin film membrane) with properties between those of a conducting polymer and those of a carbon. After carbonization, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphology and the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) Guinier radius remain largely unchanged as does the cumulative pore volume. However, the BET surface area is decreased to 242 m2g\u20131, but microporosity is considerably increased. The new material is shown to exhibit noticeable electrochemical features including two pH-dependent capacitance domains switching from ca. 33 Fg\u20131 (when oxidized) to ca. 147 Fg\u20131 (when reduced), a low electron transfer reactivity toward oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and a four-point-probe resistivity (dry) of approximately 40 M\u03a9/square for a 1\u20132 \u03bcm thick film.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCopper indium disulphide (CuInS2) thin films were deposited using the electrostatic spray deposition method. The effects of applied voltage and solution flow rate on the aerosol cone shape, film composition, surface morphology and current conversion were investigated. The effect of aluminium substrates and transparent fluorine doped tin oxide (SnO2:F) coated glass substrates on the properties of as-deposited CuInS2 films were analysed. An oxidation process occurs during the deposition onto the metallic substrates which forms an insulating layer between the photoactive film and substrate. The effects of two different spray needles on the properties of the as-deposited films were also studied. The results reveal that the use of a stainless steel needle results in contamination of the film due to the transfer of metal impurities through the spray whilst this is not seen for the glass needle. The films were characterised using a number of different analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Rutherford back-scattering and secondary ion mass spectroscopy and opto-electronic measurements.",

Atomistic simulation and density functional theory (DFT) techniques are employed to provide insights into the defect and redox chemistry, the structural changes upon lithium extraction and the mechanisms of lithium ion diffusion. The most favourable intrinsic defects are Li/Mn anti-site pairs, where Li and Mn ions occupy interchanged positions, and Li Frenkel defects. DFT calculations reproduce the experimental cell voltage and confirm the presence of the unusually high MnV redox state, which corresponds to a theoretical capacity of nearly 288 mA h g\u22121. The ability to reach the high manganese oxidation state is related to both the initial tetrahedral coordination of Mn and the observed distortion/tilting of the BO3 units to accommodate the contraction of the Mn\u2013O bonds upon oxidation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate fast three-dimensional lithium diffusion in line with the good rate performance observed.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

A PIM-EA-TB film containing catalyst is deposited onto the electrode and immersed for voltammetry (i) with 4-(3-phenyl-propyl)-pyridine to give an organogel, or (ii) bare directly into aqueous solution. The porous host allows processes to be optimised as a function of solution phase, composition, and catalyst loading. Effective electron transfer as well as effective electrocatalysis is reported for aqueous oxygen and peroxide reduction.

The theoretical molecular structures predicted are confirmed by the reproduction of their respective IR and Raman spectral profiles, that are completely assigned. Some evidence in the vibrational spectra points to the occurrence of conformational mixtures in the samples.Further, single-crystal X-ray diffraction has allowed the elucidation of the crystalline structure of 2-{[methyl(diphenyl)silyl]methyl}-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione.",

    "abstract": " Structural and thermodynamic data are presented on the binding properties of anion receptors containing two covalently linked cyclopeptide subunits that bind sulfate and iodide anions with micromolar affinity in aqueous solution. A synchrotron X-ray crystal structure of the sulfate complex of one receptor revealed that the anion is bound between the peptide rings of the biscyclopeptide. Intimate intramolecular contacts between the nonpolar surfaces of the proline rings of the individual receptor moieties in the complex suggest that hydrophobic interactions within the receptor that do not directly involve the guest contribute to complex stability. This finding is supported by a microcalorimetric analysis of the solvent dependence of complex stability, which showed that increasing the water content of the solvent has only a weak influence on the Gibbs energy of binding. Hence, the increasing amount of energy required for desolvating the binding partners in solutions containing more water is almost compensated by the increasingly favorable hydrophobic interactions. Further observations that suggest that guest-induced intra-receptor interactions contribute to guest binding are (i) anion binding of a monomeric cyclopeptide lacking the covalent linkage between the two rings leads to the formation of 2:1 complexes; (ii) in the crystal structure of the 2:1 iodide complex of this monotopic receptor, a similar arrangement of the two cyclopeptide rings has been found as in the sulfate complex of the biscyclopeptide; (iii) complex formation of the monomeric cyclopeptide in aqueous solution is highly cooperative with a large stability constant corresponding to the formation of the 2:1 complexes from relatively instable 1:1 complexes; (iv) the monomeric cyclopeptide forms only 1:1 anion complexes in DMSO where hydrophobic interactions do not take place; and (v) introducing polar hydroxy groups on the proline rings of the monomeric cyclopeptide disrupts cooperativity causing the formation of only 1:1 complexes even in aqueous solution. Taken together these observations demonstrate that, in addition to direct receptor\u2212substrate interactions, noncovalent interactions between the two subunits of such biscyclopeptides contribute significantly to anion complex stability. Reinforcement of molecular recognition through intra-receptor interactions should be an attractive new strategy to boost host\u2212guest affinities.  ",

    "abstract": " With the increasing demand for new materials, analytical techniques which are able to rapidly characterize a large number of samples are becoming indispensable. Thin film technology has the potential to improve the amount of information contained on as-deposited samples by creating compositionally graded libraries. Conventionally, raster scan methods are used to interrogate such libraries but, in this paper, a different approach is presented to provide a method of high-throughput data collection and analysis using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) probe. An extended X-ray beam was used to illuminate the libraries, and a large area detector was used to collect the data. A new algorithm \u201cBandit\u201d has been employed to analyze the collected data and extract the crystallographic information. The results of the technique have been compared with the raster scans showing that the algorithm provides reliable data at a significantly increased data acquisition speed.",

It has been shown that, even at the nano-scale, one of the same two principle mechanisms that have been observed previously in mercury porosimetry experiments on macroscopic glass pore models also occur within a given amorphous, nanoporous solid. Using percolation theory to interpret novel, integrated gas sorption experiments, entrapment was shown to arise, either because of the presence of sufficiently narrow pore necks interspersed between larger voids, or due to non-random, longer-range structural heterogeneity. The threshold \"snap-off\" ratio parameter for the entrapment process has also been directly measured but found to be considerably smaller than seen previously for macroporous materials. The techniques employed here enable information not previously available for nanoporous systems to be determined, and therefore to be incorporated into simulations of mercury porosimetry on those materials.",

    "abstract": "There is currently renewed interest in aqueous dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Water ingress in conventional DSCs leads to a loss of efficiency; one solution to this problem is to optimize the cells to work in the presence of water. The aim is to create a stable cell and to avoid the need for buffer layers and encapsulation that increase device cost. Water containing electrolytes generally give lower photocurrents than those based on organic solvents, a problem that has in part been attributed to poor pore filling by the aqueous electrolyte. Here, two sets of cells have been made that are identical except for the nature of the solvent (water or acetonitrile). Photocurrent mapping has been used to compare spatially resolved inhomogeneities in the current density. High-resolution transmission mapping (3906 data points/cm2) has been used to decouple dye coverage and film thickness from electrolyte permeation. Filling cells using heating and vacuum was found to improve water electrolyte permeation. Photocurrent maps suggest that dye desorption occurs adjacent to the filling holes in both acetonitrile- and water-based cells, with significantly more dye desorbed in the water-based cells. The loss of dye was attributed to desorption by the tert-butyl pyridine base in the electrolyte.",

The concept of thermodynamically independent pores within networks has also been challenged. In this work, a novel integrated nitrogen sorption and mercury porosimetry technique has been used to deconvolve the condensation and evaporation processes within a specific subset of pores contained within a larger, irregular network. The sizes and geometry of these pores were obtained completely independently of gas sorption, using mercury porosimetry and NMR cryoporometry, respectively. Hence, various theories of capillary condensation, such as the Kelvin equation, the Broeckhoff-de Boer method, Saam-Cole theory, and NLDFT could be directly tested, and the potential influence of any collective network phenomena detected. It was found that, even for a shielded pore, the Cohan equation for a cylindrical meniscus gave rise to the best prediction for the relative pressure of capillary condensation, once the effects of surface chemical heterogeneity on multi-layer build-up had been taken into account. The results were also found to be incompatible with the presence of particular collective adsorption effects, such as advanced condensation.            ",

It has been found that this equation is also suitable for the interpretation of raw data for sol\u2013gel silica spheres. Interpretation of mercury porosimetry data using the alternative to the standard Washburn equation was found to give rise to pore sizes similar to those obtained from corresponding SAXS data. The interpretation of porosimetry data, for both whole and finely powdered silica spheres, using the alternative expression has demonstrated that the hysteresis and mercury entrapment observed for whole samples does not occur for fragmented samples. Therefore, for these materials, the structural hysteresis and overall level of mercury entrapment is caused by the macroscopic (>\u223c30 \u00ce\u00bcm), and not the microscopic (<\u223c30 \u00ce\u00bcm), properties of the porous medium. This finding suggested that mercury porosimetry may be used to obtain a statistical characterization of sample macroscopic structure similar to that obtained using MRI. In addition, from a comparison of the pore size distribution from porosimetry with that obtained using complementary nitrogen sorption data, it was found that, even in the absence of hysteresis and mercury entrapment, pore shielding effects were still present. This observation suggested that the mercury extrusion process does not occur by a piston-type retraction mechanism and, therefore, the usual method for the application of percolation concepts to mercury retraction is flawed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA simple and sensitive photoelectrochemical sensor based on the bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanode coupled to visible light excitation was developed for nitrite detection. The BiVO4 was prepared by hydrothermal methods and used as photoelectroactive sensor. Photoexcitation with visible light allows nitrite anions to act as highly efficient hole scavenger at low potential. The photocurrent response increases linearly with nitrite concentration in the solution. The proposed device operates in the range of detection (2.5 to 100.0\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcmol\u00a0L\u20131), with limit of detection (1.5\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcmol\u00a0L\u20131), and with good reproducibility (4.1%) for nitrite analysis.",

The preparation of the precursor mixture and the formation of the ceramic product were monitored using TG/DTA, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). The results show that sol\u2013gel proteic route is a reliable method for the synthesis of pure BaAl2O4 powders and that irregular hexagonal facetted nanoparticles are observed. Atomistic modeling was used to calculate the structures and energies of 24 (hkl) surfaces and to evaluate morphologies of BaAl2O4 at the thermodynamic and pseudo-kinetic equilibrium. The calculations show that the two most stable surfaces are the (001) and (011) with a surface energy of 1.33\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122 and 1.36\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122 respectively and that the predicted morphologies are in accord with experiment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe present work focuses on research into alternative and more scalable processes for organometal halide perovskite layer deposition. We compare solar cells fabricated by sequential step deposition of the perovskite layer, where the PbI2 film is deposited using either blade or spin coating. By controlling the crystallization of the PbI2 with air flow, a highly compact layer was obtained with both techniques. The final perovskite structure was then obtained by dipping the substrates in a methylammonium iodide solution. The study and the consequent optimization of the blade coating process and the dipping time, led us to achieve 10\u00a0mm2 solar cells with a maximum efficiency of 13.3% and an average efficiency of 12.1%. To prove the scalability of the process, series connected modules were fabricated containing blade coated PbI2 films. The films were laser patterned with a CO2 laser before being dipped in the methylamine iodide solution. A module efficiency of 10.4% was obtained for a 10.1\u00a0cm2 active area. An efficiency of 4.3% was measured for a module area of 100\u00a0cm2.",

The effects of temperature and temperature gradients on ZnO electro-formation at fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes are investigated with both a conventional thermostated bath system (isothermal) and an in situ microwave electrochemistry system (non-isothermal). Mainly electrodeposition of ZnO is observed in uniformly heated stagnant solution and predominantly the electro-formation of ZnO colloid is observed in the presence of microwave-induced temperature gradients in a flowing solution. For the ZnO colloid prepared via microwave activation, SAXS data suggests an average particle radius of ca. 18\u00a0nm. The increase of ZnO nanoparticle concentration during repetitive potential scans is followed by photoluminescence spectroscopy. A possible mechanism for ZnO colloid formation during electrochemical reduction of H2O2 is suggested.",

Here, a symmetric gold\u2013gold junction grown by controlled electro-deposition is employed for generator\u2013collector voltammetry in conjunction with microwave activation.

The resulting increase in the rate of diffusion and the onset of convection result in non-linear Arrhenius limiting current characteristics and in an increase in collection efficiency with microwave power. The gold electrode junction geometry allows diffusion effects (which increase the feedback current within the gap) to dominate over convection effects (which suppress the feedback current).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Working on the hypothesis that an important function of the lamellate antennae of adult male beetles belonging to the genus Rhipicera is to detect scent associated with female conspecifics, and using field observations, anatomical models derived from X-ray microcomputed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy, we have investigated the behavioral, morphological, and morphometric factors that may influence molecule capture by these antennae. We found that male beetles fly upwind in a zigzag manner, or face upwind when perching, behavior consistent with an animal that is tracking scent. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of the male and female antennae, like their gross morphology, is sexually dimorphic, with male antennae possessing many more of a particular type of receptor\u2014the sensillum placodeum\u2014than their female counterparts (approximately 30,000 vs. 100 per antenna, respectively). Based on this disparity, we assume that the sensilla placodea on the male antennae are responsible for detecting scent associated with female Rhipicera beetles. Molecule capture by male antennae in their alert, fanned states is likely to be favoured by: (a) male beetles adopting prominent, upright positions on high points when searching for scent; (b) the partitioning of antennae into many small segments; (c) antennal morphometry (height, width, outline area, total surface area, leakiness, and narrow channels); (d) the location of the sensilla placodea where they are most likely to encounter odorant molecules; and (e) well dispersed sensilla placodea. The molecule-capturing ability of male Rhipicera antennae may be similar to that of the pectinate antennae of certain male moths.

    "abstract": " A novel glucose sensing concept based on the localized change or \u201cmodulation\u201d in pH within a symmetric gold\u2212gold junction electrode is proposed. A paired gold\u2212gold junction electrode (average gap size ca. 500 nm) is prepared by simultaneous bipotentiostatic electrodeposition of gold onto two closely spaced platinum disk electrodes. For glucose detection in neutral aqueous solution, the potential of the \u201cpH-modulator\u201d electrode is set to \u22121.5 V vs saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) to locally increase the pH, and simultaneously, either cyclic voltammetry or square wave voltammetry experiments are conducted at the sensor electrode. A considerable improvement in the sensor electrode response is observed when a normal pulse voltammetry sequence is applied to the modulator electrode (to generate \u201chydroxide pulses\u201d) and the glucose sensor electrode is operated with fixed bias at +0.5 V vs SCE (to eliminate capacitive charging currents). Preliminary data suggest good linearity for the glucose response in the medically relevant 1\u221210 mM concentration range (corresponding to 0.18\u22121.8 g L\u22121). Future electroanalytical applications of multidimensional pulse voltammetry in junction electrodes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn situ microwave activation is investigated for the electrodeposition of a metal (gold) and for a metal oxide (hydrous Ti(IV) oxide) onto tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) film electrodes. It is demonstrated that localized microwave heating of the ITO film can be exploited to affect electrodeposition processes.The electrochemically reversible and temperature sensitive one-electron redox system Fe(CN)63\u2212/4\u2212 was employed in aqueous solution in order to calibrate the average surface temperature at the ITO film electrode. In the presence of microwave radiation the average electrode surface temperature reached ca. 363\u00a0K whereas under the same conditions the bulk solution temperature reached ca. 313\u00a0K. Therefore localized heating of the ITO film appears to be important.The rate of electrodeposition of gold from an aqueous 1\u00a0mM tetrachloroaurate(III) solution in 0.1\u00a0M KCl (adjusted to pH 2) is enhanced by microwave activation. However, the morphology of deposits remains un-effected. Hydrous titanium (IV) oxide films were electrodeposited from an aqueous solution of 1\u00a0mM TiCl3 in 0.1\u00a0M acetate buffer pH 4.7. Dense films with blocking character were obtained with conventional heating but a fibrous more open deposit forms in the presence of microwaves.",

    "abstract": "A thin composite film of carbon nanoparticles (ca. 8\u2005nm diameter) and chitosan biopolymer (poly-D-glucosamine, from chitin, 75\u201385% deacetylated) was prepared by evaporation from aqueous dispersion onto glassy carbon electrode surfaces. The amine groups in the chitosan biopolymer were used to effectively bind Hg(II) ions from an aqueous pH\u20055 KCl solution. During redox cycling voltammetric responses for bound mercury are readily observed and mercury nanodroplets (ca. 5.4 (\u00b11.0)\u2005nm diameter based on SAXS measurements) are formed in the film by applying a negative potential. The binding of Hg(II) ions to the chitosan\u2013carbon nanoparticle film occurs with an approximate Langmuirian constant of 2.7\u00d7104 mol\u22121dm3 and the process is dependent on (i) the chitosan content in the film, (ii) the Hg2+ concentration, and (iii) the immobilization time. The immobilized mercury nanodroplets within the carbon nanoparticle\u2013chitosan film are electrochemically active and allow the co-deposition of other metals in the form of amalgams. Preliminary experiments for the anodic stripping voltammetry for Pb2+ and for Cu2+ are demonstrated. Mercury nanodroplet modified chitosan\u2013carbon nanoparticle film electrodes represent a novel electroanalytical tool.",

Electrochemical behavior and stability of modified CCE were investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The electrocatalytic activity of CCE was investigated and showed a good effect for oxidation of hydrazine in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). A linear concentration range of 6\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM to 1.2\u00a0mM of hydrazine with an experimental detection limit of 1\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM of hydrazine was obtained. The diffusion coefficient of hydrazine and its catalytic rate constant for electrocatalytic reaction along with the apparent electron transfer rate constant (ks) and transfer coefficient (\u00ce\u00b1) were also determined.The modified carbon ceramic electrode doped with this new Ru-complex showed good reproducibility, short response time (t\u00a0<\u00a02\u00a0s), remarkable long-term stability (>3 month) and especially good surface renewability by simple mechanical polishing.The results showed that this electrode could be used as an electrochemical sensor for determination of hydrazine in real water samples used in Fars Power Plant Station, including its heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) water (at different operational condition), cooling system and clean waste water.",

    "abstract": " In this paper, nanostructures formed in water by a novel series of (G)n(PO)68(G)n triblock copolymers, where n = 18\u2212135, and G and PO stand for glycidol and propylene oxide, respectively, are parametrized. The copolymers are considered analogues of Pluronic copolymers in which the flanking poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) blocks are substituted by polyglycidol (PG). PG is structurally similar to PEO and differs in that each monomer unit bears a hydroxymethylene group. In composition, the copolymers are closest to the Pluronic series L121\u2212F127. Dilute (but invariably above the critical aggregation concentration) aqueous solutions in the temperature interval 25\u221270 \u00b0C were investigated by means of dynamic and static light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). In the temperature-composition continuum studied the novel copolymers exhibit rich structural polymorphism. Large compound particles as those observed earlier for related copolymers, small core-corona micelles, rods, and vesicles were detected and parametrized by combining light scattering and SANS. Upon heating, the simultaneous increase in both hydrophobicity of poly(propylene oxide) and hydrophilicity of PG cause counteracting effects that are reflected in appearance of maxima in the temperature dependence of aggregation numbers of the particles, variations in the density of the latter, and anomalous thermotropic transitions for some of the copolymers.",

    "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) have been widely used for fluorescent imaging in cells. In particular, surface functionalized QDs are of interest, since they possess the ability to recognize and detect the analytes in the surrounding nanoscale environment based on electron and hole transfer between the analytes and the QDs. Here we demonstrate that fluorescence enhancement/quenching in QDs can be switched by electrochemically modulating electron transfer between attached molecules and QDs. For this purpose, a number of redox-active coenzyme\u2005Q (CoQ) disulfide derivatives [CoQCnS]2 were synthesized with different alkyl chain lengths (n=1, 5, and 10). The system supremely sensitive to NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and superoxide radical (O2.\u2212), and represents a biomimetic electron-transfer system, modeling part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of our in situ fluorescence spectroelectrochemical study demonstrate that the reduced state of [CoQCnS]2 significantly enhanced the fluorescence intensity of CdTe/ZnS QDs, while the oxidized state of the CoQ conjugates quench the fluorescence to varying degrees. Fluorescence imaging of cells loaded with the conjugate QD-[CoQCnS]2 displayed strikingly differences in the fluorescence depending on the redox state of the capping layer, thus introducing a handle for evaluating the status of the cellular redox potential status. Moreover, an MTT assay (MTT=3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) proved that the cytotoxicity of QDs was significantly reduced after immobilization by CoQ derivatives. Those unique features make CoQ derivatived QDs as a promising probe to image redox coenzyme function in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid microspheres have been used for taste masking purposes whereby the drug is preferentially released in the lower gastrointestinal tract, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. In this study, we use a combination of surface pressure measurements, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and neutron reflectivity measurements to study the phase miscibility and escaping tendency from mixed stearic and palmitic acid films with a view to relating this to drug dissolution behaviour. It was noted that mixed systems showed considerably greater film interaction and instability than those composed of the pure lipid, especially in alkaline media. BAM studies were able to identify a range of phase separated structures for both the pure and mixed systems. Neutron reflectivity studies indicated a marked selective dissolution of palmitic acid into the subphase as a function of time and allowed quantification of the rate of dissolution of this species. It is concluded that the fatty acids are interacting within the monolayer and in addition the palmitic acid is escaping the mixed monolayers and dissolving into the alkali subphase. These findings have strong relevance for understanding the mechanism of drug release from the associated microspheres. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 97: 1864\u20131877, 2008",

The solubility of Mg2+ is much greater in MnO than the reverse, reflecting the difference in size between the two cations. The solubility, for a given temperature, diminishes with nanoparticle size. As the Mn concentration is progressively increased the Mn2+ ions occupy the corners, edges and then surface sites of the nanoparticle before entering subsurface layers. We do not observe any pronounced ordering of the cations within the body of the nanoparticles themselves. The enthalpies of forming ternary nanoparticles from particles of MgO and MnO of the same size vary with the size of the nanoparticle and become more positive for a given concentration as the particle size increases. Free energies of mixing of the two end-member nanoparticles have been determined using the semigrand ensemble.

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage therapy is a promising new treatment that may help overcome the threat posed by antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria, which are increasingly identified in hospitalized patients. The development of biocompatible and sustainable vehicles for incorporation of viable bacterial viruses into a wound dressing is a promising alternative. This article evaluates the antimicrobial efficacy of Bacteriophage K against Staphylococcus aureus over time, when stabilized and delivered via an oil-in-water nano-emulsion. Nano-emulsions were formulated via thermal phase inversion emulsification, and then bacterial growth was challenged with either native emulsion, or emulsion combined with Bacteriophage K. Bacteriophage infectivity, and the influence of storage time of the preparation, were assessed by turbidity measurements of bacterial samples. Newly prepared Bacteriophage K/nano-emulsion formulations have greater antimicrobial activity than freely suspended bacteriophage. The phage-loaded emulsions caused rapid and complete bacterial death of three different strains of S. aureus. The same effect was observed for preparations that were either stored at room temperature (18\u201320\u00b0C), or chilled at 4\u00b0C, for up to 10 days of storage. A response surface design of experiments was used to gain insight on the relative effects of the emulsion formulation on bacterial growth and phage lytic activity. More diluted emulsions had a less significant effect on bacterial growth, and diluted bacteriophage-emulsion preparations yielded greater antibacterial activity. The enhancement of bacteriophage activity when delivered via nano-emulsions is yet to be reported. This prompts further investigation into the use of these formulations for the development of novel anti-microbial wound management strategies. \u00a9 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe surface structure of In2O3(111) has been investigated by dynamical analysis of low energy electron diffraction data, in conjunction with first principles calculations using density functional theory. The experimental data set consisted of eight independent beams whose intensities were measured for incident energies in the range between 25\u00a0eV and 250\u00a0eV. In fitting the experimental data it was essential to treat the radii of In and O spheres as variable parameters: following this procedure a final Pendry R factor of 0.31 was obtained. The LEED results are compatible with the calculations and both analyses suggest that the surface structure involves only small vertical relaxations in the outermost of the {[O2\u2212]1224\u2212[In3+]1648+[O2\u2212]1224\u2212} quadrupolar units that define the (111) surface. The ab initio slab calculations also confirm that lateral relaxations not considered in fitting the experimental data are of very minor importance.",

    "abstract": "We report the synthesis and characterization of a family of cobalt(III) metal precursors, based around cyclopentadienyl and diazabutadiene ligands. The molecular structure of the complexes cyclopentadienyl-Cobalt(III)(N,N\u2032-dicyclohexyl-diazabutadiene) (2c) and cyclopentadienyl-Cobalt(III)(N,N\u2032-dimesityl-diazabutadiene) (2d) are described, as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis of the complexes highlighted the isopropyl derivative CpCo(iPr2-dab) (2a) as a possible cobalt metal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) precursor. Atmospheric pressure CVD (AP-CVD) was employed using precursor 2a to synthesize thin films of metallic cobalt on silicon substrates under an atmosphere of hydrogen (H2). Analysis of the thin films deposited at substrate temperatures of 250 \u00b0C, 275 \u00b0C, 300 \u00b0C, 325 \u00b0C, and 350 \u00b0C, respectively, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveal temperature dependent growth features: films grown at 325 and 350 \u00b0C are continuous and pinhole free, whereas those films grown at substrate temperatures of 250 \u00b0C, 275 \u00b0C, and 300 \u00b0C consist of crystalline nanoparticles. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) all show the films to be high purity metallic cobalt. Raman spectroscopy has also been used to prove the absence of cobalt silicides at the substrate/thin film interface.",

    "abstract": "Metal halides perovskites, such as hybrid organic\u2013inorganic CH3NH3PbI3, are newcomer optoelectronic materials that have attracted enormous attention as solution-deposited absorbing layers in solar cells with power conversion efficiencies reaching 20%. Herein we demonstrate a new avenue for halide perovskites by designing highly luminescent perovskite-based colloidal quantum dot materials. We have synthesized monodisperse colloidal nanocubes (4\u201315 nm edge lengths) of fully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I or mixed halide systems Cl/Br and Br/I) using inexpensive commercial precursors. Through compositional modulations and quantum size-effects, the bandgap energies and emission spectra are readily tunable over the entire visible spectral region of 410\u2013700 nm. The photoluminescence of CsPbX3 nanocrystals is characterized by narrow emission line-widths of 12\u201342 nm, wide color gamut covering up to 140% of the NTSC color standard, high quantum yields of up to 90%, and radiative lifetimes in the range of 1\u201329 ns. The compelling combination of enhanced optical properties and chemical robustness makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals appealing for optoelectronic applications, particularly for blue and green spectral regions (410\u2013530 nm), where typical metal chalcogenide-based quantum dots suffer from photodegradation.Keywords:  Perovskites; halides; quantum dots; nanocrystals; optoelectronics",

Mapping the emission from luminol solution revealed the distribution of cavitation produced in water around the tips. Hydroxyl radical production rates arising from water sonolysis were measured using terephthalate dosimetry and found to be in the range of \u00ce\u00bcmol\u00a0min\u22121, comparable with those from a sonochemical horn. Removal of an ink coating from a glass slide showed that cleaning occurred primarily where the tip contacted the surface but was also observed in regions where cavitation occurred even when the tip did not contact the surface. Differences in behaviour were noted between different tip designs and computer simulation of the acoustic pressure distributions using COMSOL showed the reasons behind the different behaviour of the tip designs.",

For short reaction times or treatment at low intensity, precipitates containing up to 90% vaterite were recovered; longer (>30 min) times or higher intensities yielded up to 100% calcite. Changes in the crystal sizes were noted. The results are consistent with the literature model of CaCO3 crystallization by the initial formation of vaterite followed by a dissolution\u2212recrystallization process.

In this work, the technique of radical trapping, primarily using DPPH, has been used to measure radical production rates in a range of monomer and related systems when exposed to high intensity ultrasound. It has been shown that realistic rates of production can be obtained around room temperature equivalent to thermal decomposition rates > 100\u00b0C, making sonication a viable method for initiating polymerisation. Rates of initiation in a twophase organic in water system have also been measured. Some of the initiating species have been identified recording the ESR spectra of adducts with spin traps, although further analysis is needed before the complete range of radicals produced can be identified.",

    "abstract": "Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) has been used to characterize the surfaces of a pure calcitic calcium carbonate as well as samples that had been treated with sodium polyacrylate and/or stearic acid. The dispersive components of the surface free energy for the pure material agreed well with related literature data. Polar contributions to the surface interactions with a range of probes were determined. The results show that the surface treatments reduced the polarities of the surfaces and that modification with stearic acid produced a non-polar, low-energy surface. Some mechanical properties of the polypropylene composites containing the modified calcium carbonates were found to correlate well with the filler surface energies.

The crystal structure of 1 shows a linear arrangement at the Hg(II) centre of the molecule through bonding of the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand and the carbon atom of the aromatic ring. Weak intermolecular thiophilic Hg\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S interactions lead to a \u201chead-to-tail\u201d dimer and the presence of a hydroxyl group at the periphery of piperidine moiety generates a 1D-chain network through intermolecular O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H interactions.

Differences in antimicrobial efficacy of the two compounds were observed, suggesting possible mechanisms for antimicrobial activity. The ZSB system was plasma deposited under various pulse conditions onto non-woven fabric, and the antimicrobial efficacy of the resultant film measured for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest the potential utility of this compound as an effective antimicrobial thin film, and confirm the critical role the ligands play in effecting antimicrobial activity.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical co-crystals are multicomponent molecular systems typically formed through hydrogen bonding of a co-former molecule with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Just as many single component molecular structures can exhibit polymorphism due to the geometry of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, the same is true for pharmaceutical co-crystals. In this study, the selective co-crystallization of the desired polymorphic form of urea-barbituric acid (UBA) co-crystals (forms I and III) is demonstrated, applying a novel periodic mixed suspension mixed product removal (PMSMPR) crystallizer cascade. The process was monitored using an integrated process analytical technology (PAT) array consisting of Raman spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance ultraviolet/visible (ATR-UV/vis) spectroscopy, focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), particle vision microscopy (PVM), and an in-house developed commercial crystallization process informatics system (CryPRINS) software tool to determine when a \u201cstate of controlled operation\u201d (SCO) was achieved. Three different start-up strategies were employed and their ability to produce selectively a particular polymorphic form of UBA was evaluated. The experimental conditions for producing pure UBA form I were optimized, but pure UBA form III remained elusive. Off-line characterization of the UBA polymorphs was carried out using Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Raman spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Amino-acid functionalized naphthalenediimides self-assemble into hydrogen-bonded supramolecular helical nanotubes via a noncooperative, isodesmic process; the self-assembly of ordered helical systems is usually realized through a cooperative process. This unexpected behavior was rationalized as a manifestation of entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation. Fundamental insights into the thermodynamics governing this self-assembly were obtained through the fitting of the isodesmic model to 1H NMR spectrometry and circular dichroism spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, we have extended the application of this mathematical model, for the first time, to quantitatively estimate the effect of guests, solvents, and side chains on the stability of the supramolecular nanotube; most significantly, we demonstrate that C60 acts as a template to stabilize the nanotube assembly and thereby substantially increase the degree of polymerization.",

An evanescent wave generated by a surface plasmon resonance in a metal layer is the incident light field in the dynamic light scattering experiment. The combination of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering leads to a spatiotemporal resolution extending a few hundred nanometers from the surface and from microseconds to seconds. The comparison with evanescent wave dynamic light scattering identifies the advantages of the presented technique, e.g., surface monitoring, use of metal surfaces, and biorelevant systems.

    "abstract": "A homochiral naphthalenediimide-based building block forms in water a disulfide library of macrocycles containing topological isomers. We attempted to identify each of these isomers, and explored the mechanisms leading to their formation. The two most abundant species of the library were assigned as a topologically chiral Solomon link (60% of the library, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) and a topologically achiral figure eight knot (18% by HPLC), competing products with formally different geometries but remarkably similar 4-fold symmetries. In contrast, a racemic mixture of building blocks gives the near-quantitative formation of another new and more stable structure, assigned as a meso figure eight knot. Taken together, these results seem to uncover a correlation between the point chirality of the building block used and the topological chirality of the major structure formed. These and the earlier discovery of a trefoil knot also suggest that the number of rigid components in the building block may translate into corresponding knot symmetry and could set the basis of a new strategy for constructing complex topologies.",

    "abstract": "Publisher SummaryThe compounds of pyridine and piperidine alkaloids are plant bases and are being isolated from insects and from amphibians and marine animals. They are widely distributed in nature and they perform a number of different functions in nature, such as train pheromones and defense mechanisms in insects. In many cases, the stereochemistry is complex and the syntheses require sophisticated asymmetric methods. This chapter discusses these compounds for their synthesis and derivatives, and their applications. The section on terpenoid piperidine alkaloids found in plants is used for the treatment of rheumatism and is discussed as an analgesic in the chapter. A number of polyhydroxypiperidines (azahexoses) are known for creating much interest, as they show glycosidase inhibitory activity. The benefits and applications of spiropiperidine alkaloids are explained for their chemical methods and resulting compounds. The perhydroquinoline alkaloids\u2014such as lepadin A (103), a cis-decahydroquinoline alkaloid, can be obtained from the north-sea tunicate clavelinia lepadiformis. The different types of pyridine alkaloids are presented for the reader. The compounds pyridine, dihydropyridone and tetrahydropiperidone alkaloids are briefly discussed.",

    "abstract": "Thin film lead halide perovskite cells, where the perovskite layer is deposited directly onto a flat titania blocking layer, have reached AM 1.5 efficiencies of over 15%,1 showing that the mesoporous scaffold used in early types of perovskite solar cells is not essential. We  used a variety of techniques to gain a better understanding of thin film perovskite cells prepared by a solution-based method. Twelve cells were studied, which showed AM 1.5 efficiencies of \u223c11%. The properties of the cells were investigated using impedance spectroscopy, intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), and open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD). Despite the fact that all 12 cells were prepared at the same time under nominally identical conditions, their behavior fell into two distinct groups. One half of the cells exhibited ideality factors of m \u2248 2.5, and the other half showed ideality factors of m \u2248 5. Impedance spectroscopy carried out under illumination at open circuit for a range of intensities showed that the cell capacitance was dominated by the geometric capacitance of the perovskite layer rather than the chemical or diffusion capacitance due to photogenerated carriers. The voltage dependence of the recombination resistance gave ideality factors similar to those derived from the intensity dependence of the open-circuit voltage. The IMVS time constant was determined by the product of the geometric capacitance and the recombination resistance. The two types of cells gave very different OCVD responses. The cells with m \u2248 2.5 showed a persistent photovoltage effect that was absent in the case of the cells with higher ideality factors. The IMPS responses provide evidence of minor efficiency losses by recombination under short-circuit conditions.",

Here we report friction measurements of several nanostructured surfaces using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). These nanostructured surfaces provide well defined model systems on which we have tested the applicability of Amontons' laws of friction. Our results show that Amontonian behaviour is observed with each of the surfaces studied. However, no correlation has been found between measured friction and various surface roughness parameters such as average surface roughness (Ra) and root mean squared (rms) roughness. Instead, we propose that the friction coefficient may be decomposed into two contributions, i.e., \u03bc = \u03bc0 + \u03bcg, with the intrinsic friction coefficient \u03bc0 accounting for the chemical nature of the surfaces and the geometric friction coefficient \u03bcg for the presence of nanotextures. We have found a possible correlation between \u03bcg and the average local slope of the surface nanotextures.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis review identifies understudied areas of emerging contaminant (EC) research in wastewaters and the environment, and recommends direction for future monitoring. Non-regulated trace organic ECs including pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs and personal care products are focused on due to ongoing policy initiatives and the expectant broadening of environmental legislation. These ECs are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, mainly derived from the discharge of municipal wastewater effluents. Their presence is of concern due to the possible ecological impact (e.g., endocrine disruption) to biota within the environment. To better understand their fate in wastewaters and in the environment, a standardised approach to sampling is needed. This ensures representative data is attained and facilitates a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of EC occurrence. During wastewater treatment, there is a lack of suspended particulate matter analysis due to further preparation requirements and a lack of good analytical approaches. This results in the under-reporting of several ECs entering wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and the aquatic environment. Also, sludge can act as a concentrating medium for some chemicals during wastewater treatment. The majority of treated sludge is applied directly to agricultural land without analysis for ECs. As a result there is a paucity of information on the fate of ECs in soils and consequently, there has been no driver to investigate the toxicity to exposed terrestrial organisms. Therefore a more holistic approach to environmental monitoring is required, such that the fate and impact of ECs in all exposed environmental compartments are studied. The traditional analytical approach of applying targeted screening with low resolution mass spectrometry (e.g., triple quadrupoles) results in numerous chemicals such as transformation products going undetected. These can exhibit similar toxicity to the parent EC, demonstrating the necessity of using an integrated analytical approach which compliments targeted and non-targeted screening with biological assays to measure ecological impact. With respect to current toxicity testing protocols, failure to consider the enantiomeric distribution of chiral compounds found in the environment, and the possible toxicological differences between enantiomers is concerning. Such information is essential for the development of more accurate environmental risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Light-driven water-splitting (photoelectrolysis) at semiconductor electrodes continues to excite interest as a potential route to produce hydrogen as a sustainable fuel, but surprisingly little is known about the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions involved. Here, some basic principles of semiconductor photoelectrochemistry are reviewed with particular emphasis on the effects of slow interfacial electron transfer at n-type semiconductors in the case of light-driven oxygen evolution. A simple kinetic model is outlined that considers the competition between interfacial transfer of photogenerated holes and surface recombination. The model shows that, if interfacial charge transfer is very slow, the build-up of holes at the surface will lead to substantial changes in the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer, leading to non-ideal behavior (Fermi level pinning). The kinetic model is also used to predict the response of photoanodes to chopped illumination and to periodic perturbations of illumination and potential. Recent experimental results obtained for \u03b1-Fe2O3 (hematite) photoanodes are reviewed and interpreted within the framework of the model.",

Analysis of the frequency-dependent IMPS response gives information about the competition between the 4-electron oxidation of water by photogenerated holes and losses due to electron-hole recombination via surface states. The very slow kinetics of oxygen evolution indicates the presence of a kinetic bottleneck in the overall process. Surface treatment of the \u03b1-Fe2O3 with dilute cobalt nitrate solution leads to a remarkable improvement in the photocurrent response, but contrary to expectation, the results of this study show that this is not due to catalysis of hole transfer but is instead the consequence of almost complete suppression of surface recombination.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn order to rationally design polymer vehicles for controlled drug delivery it is important to completely understand the nature and mechanisms of the structural evolution of the polymer matrix that ultimately controls drug release kinetics. NMR cryoporometry has been used previously to study drug release from polymer vehicles. However, no previous studies have employed the integrated cryoporometry and PFG NMR method known as cryodiffusometry, or explored the potential of specialized cryoporometry techniques such as scanning loops. In this work it has been shown that the true extent of the variability in structural evolution and transport properties between different batches of PLGA polymer microspheres, made in different ways, would be missed if these data were not available. Cryoporometry scanning loops have been used to determine the overall network geometry. Cryoporometry freezing curves and PFG NMR have been used to study the evolution in the pore-scale connectivity and the larger-scale inter-connectedness of the nanoporous void space following immersion of microspheres in aqueous phase. The molecular weight of the polymer used, and the presence of drug in the synthesis, have both been shown to significantly affect the trajectory of the structural evolution.",

Heating the resultant (S,S)-\u03b1-aminonitriles in 6 M aqueous HCl at reflux resulted in cleavage of their chiral auxiliary fragments and concomitant hydrolysis of their nitrile groups to afford enantiopure (S)-\u03b1-arylglycines. The enantiopurities of these (S)-\u03b1-arylglycines were determined via derivatization of their corresponding methyl esters with 2-formylphenylboronic acid and (S)-BINOL, followed by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis of the resultant mixtures of diastereomeric iminoboronate esters.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUsing a model disordered mesoporous solid with a spatial arrangement of pore sizes analogous to a macroscopic \u2018ink-bottle\u2019, it has been shown that the hysteresis observed in NMR cryoporometry can be deconvoluted into separate single pore and pore-blocking contributions. The suggestion of pore-blocking effects has been confirmed using PFG NMR. Hence, percolation theory has been used, for the first time with cryoporometry, to analyse the pore-blocking contribution to the hysteresis to determine the accessibility function and pore connectivity of the void space of a mesoporous sol\u2013gel silica catalyst support pellet. This work demonstrates that NMR cryoporometry can be used to obtain a full range of void space descriptors, and thus offers a full, and potentially better understood, complementary pore structure characterisation method to gas sorption and mercury porosimetry.",

The complexes have been characterised spectroscopically and their molecular and crystal structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. In these complexes the ligand exhibits different modes of coordination towards different transition metal ions. The structure of triethylammonium salt of the Zn(II) dianion 2 consists of an unusual tetra-zinc core supported by three POPYH ligands each one of which links two adjacent zinc centres through two oxygen and two nitrogen donor atoms. The salt of the square planar Pd(II) anion 3 contains one POPYH2 ligand which coordinates in a tridentate fashion through the two deprotonated amido groups and by the central pyridine nitrogen donor. The two Ni(II) salts 4 and 5 contain the same [Ni(POPYH)]\u2212 anion in which the square planar Ni(II) centre is chelated by a POPYH ligand through the two deprotonated amido nitrogen atoms, the pyridine nitrogen and a deprotonated hydroxyl group.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of the specialized carbohydrate affinity ligand methacrylamido phenylboronic acid in polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE analysis has been successful for the separation of carbohydrates and has here been adapted for the analysis of post-translationally modified proteins. While conventional SDS-PAGE analysis cannot distinguish between glycated and unglycated proteins, methacrylamido phenylboronate acrylamide gel electrophoresis (mP-AGE) in low loading shows dramatic retention of \u03b4-gluconolactone modified proteins, while the mobility of the unmodified proteins remains unchanged. With gels containing 1% methacrylamido phenylboronate, mP-AGE analysis of gluconoylated recombinant protein Sbi results in the retention of the modified protein at a position expected for a protein that has quadrupled its expected molecular size. Subsequently, mP-AGE was tested on HSA, a protein that is known to undergo glycation under physiological conditions. mP-AGE could distinguish between various carbohydrate-protein adducts, using in vitro glycated HSA, and discriminate early from late glycation states of the protein. Enzymatically glycosylated proteins show no altered retention in the phenylboronate-incorporated gels, rendering this method highly selective for glycated proteins. We reveal that a trident interaction between phenylboronate and the Amadori cis 1,2 diol and amine group provides the molecular basis of this specificity. These results epitomize mP-AGE as an important new proteomics tool for the detection, separation, visualization and identification of protein glycation. This method will aid the design of inhibitors of unwanted carbohydrate modifications in recombinant protein production, ageing, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": " Optical waveguide spectroscopy has been used to study the real-time adsorption of ruthenium 535-bisTBA (N-719) dye in mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide films of the type used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Porous titania films were prepared on top of gold substrates, and prism coupling was used to create a guided wave in the nanocrystalline film. The conditions under which a guided mode can be excited are dependent on both the refractive index and the extinction coefficient of the mesoporous layer, where the mesoporous layer refers to both the nanocrystals of TiO2 and the composition of the pores. It was therefore possible to track changes in dye concentration in the pores in real time. The total concentration of dye in the film appeared to continue increasing even after 22 h, in contrast to the amount of dye in the pores that was able to absorb light at 632.8 nm, which saturated after \u223c5 h. The total concentration of dye molecules was 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol cm\u22123 as a function of the total pore volume at equilibrium; assuming a regular array of spherical particles with a porosity of 0.5, this translates to 10\u22126 moles m\u22122. The value of surface coverage obtained from OWS is similar to that calculated by dye desorption studies and is close to the value previously reported for the N3 dye. (Nazeeruddin, M.

A preliminary model that simulates the increase in dye as measured by optical modes has also been developed and shows that the data does not fit a single diffusion coefficient.",

The relative intensity of a peak found at the bottom of the valence band for both oxides changes dramatically between Al K\u03b1 X-ray photoemission and O K shell X-ray emission spectra, demonstrating that the states associated with this peak possess dominant Pb 6s character. This finding is in accord with partial densities of states derived from bandstructure calculations but is at variance with the conventional view that the Pb 6s states in PbO are close to the Fermi energy and hybridise with empty 6p states to give a metal based directional 6s\u20136p lone pair. The photoemission onset of \u03b2-PbO2 contains a well-defined metallic Fermi edge. The position of the onset structure suggests that the metallic nature of PbO2 arises from occupation of conduction band states above the main valence band, probably arising from oxygen vacancy defects. The conduction electrons of \u03b2-PbO2 are strongly perturbed by ionisation of Pb core levels, giving rise to distinctive satellites in core XPS whose energies correspond to those of the conduction electron plasmon.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Rhodium(III) dihydrido complexes [Rh(L2)(H)2(acetone)][BArF4] (ArF = C6H3(CF3)2) containing the potentially hemilabile ligands L2 = 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (Xantphos) and [Ph2P(CH2)2]2O (POP\u2032) have been prepared from their corresponding norbornadiene rhodium(I) precursors. In solution these complexes are fluxional by proposed acetone dissociation, which can be trapped out by addition of MeCN to form [Rh(L2)(H)2(NCMe)][BArF4], which have been crystallographically characterized. Addition of alkene (methyl acrylate) to these complexes results in reduction to a rhodium(I) species and when followed by addition of the aldehyde HCOCH2CH2SMe affords the new acyl hydrido complexes [Rh(L2)(COCH2CH2SMe)H][BArF4] in good yield. The solid-state and solution structures show a tight binding of the POP\u2032 and Xantphos ligands, having a trans-arrangement of the phosphines with the central ether linkage bound. This is similar to the previously reported complex [Rh(DPEphos)(COCH2CH2SMe)H][BArF4] (DPEphos = [Ph2P(C6H4)]2O). Unlike the DPEphos complex, the Xantphos and POP\u2032 ligated complexes are not effective catalysts for the hydroacylation reaction between methyl acrylate and HCOCH2CH2SMe. This is traced to their inability to dissociate the central ether link in a hemilabile manner to reveal a vacant site necessary for alkene coordination. Consistent with this lack of availability of the vacant site, these complexes also are stable toward reductive decarbonylation. Complexes [Rh(Ph2P(CH2)nPPh2)(acetone)2][BArF4] (n = 2\u22125) have also been studied as catalysts for the hydroacylation reaction between methyl acrylate and HCOCH2CH2SMe at 22 \u00b0C. As found previously, for n = 2 this affords the product of alkene hydroacylation, but as the chain length is progressively increased to n = 5, the reaction also progressively changes to favor the product of aldehyde hydroacylation. This is suggested to occur by a decrease in the accessibility of the metal site on increasing the bite angle of the chelate ligand, so that alkene coordination to a putative Rh(III)-acyl hydrido intermediate is progressively disfavored and aldehyde coordination (followed by hydride transfer) is progressively favored. These, and previous, results show that the overall conversion in the hydroacylation reaction can be controlled by the hemilabile nature of the chelating phosphine in the catalyst (e.g., DPEphos versus Xantphos), and the course of the reaction can also be tuned by changing the bite angle of the phosphine, cf. Ph2P(CH2)2PPh2 and Ph2P(CH2)5PPh2.",

A variety of links were tested for holding the para-phenylene bridges in \u03c0-conjugation with the porphyrins, and the natures of these restraining links strongly influence the properties of the porphyrin dimers. The keto-linked dimer exhibits a long-lived singlet excited state and strong fluorescence at 960 nm (1.7% quantum yield) in contrast to most previously reported conjugated porphyrin tapes, which are essentially non-emissive. Replacement of the cross-conjugated keto links by directly conjugated C\u2013C bonds eradicates the fluorescence and shifts the absorption maximum to 1077 nm. On the other hand, replacement of the keto links with non-conjugated CPh2 links confers fluorescence at 736 nm (10% quantum yield) and results in remarkably similar one- and two-photon absorption behavior to that of meso\u2013meso ethynylene-bridged porphyrin dimers (peak two-photon cross section: 7,300 GM at 878 nm). Cross-conjugated keto links do more than just hold the para-phenylene bridge coplanar with the porphyrins; they reduce the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, although to a lesser extent than direct \u03c0-conjugated links. Planarized para-phenylene-bridged porphyrin dimers provide insights into the relationship between previously investigated classes of conjugated porphyrin oligomers, and they open up possibilities for the synthesis of new types of near-IR two-photon absorbing dyes.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

X-Ray crystallography shows an extended 3-dimensional network structure within a hexagonal space group with a = 9.9655(7) and c = 7.7523(7) \u00c5. The data reveal an orientational disorder to the ligand. Structural considerations suggest that the ligand orientation is strongly correlated in 1-dimension, but the nature and length scale of the 2-dimensional order is not obvious. The structure is discussed in terms of three key structural models, two of which are crystallographically ordered, while the third is disordered in 2-dimensions. The effect of ligand orientation on the network topology has profound effects on the expected magnetic behaviour, with the two fully ordered models having either antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetically ordered ground states. The magnetism of 1 is complex. It shows an antiferromagnetically coupled paramagnetic phase above \u223c5.3 K. Below \u223c4.5 K we see a ferrimagnetically ordered state (Hcoer = 50 Oe, Mrem = 1830 Oe cm3 mol\u22121, Msat = 3450 Oe cm3 mol\u22121 at 2 K). In the intermediate temperature range 4.5 to 5.3 K we see unusual behaviour with evidence of rapid, low-energy relaxation of the magnetisation. The unusual relationship between the structure and the magnetism of 1 is discussed in detail.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe compounds LnSrScO4, where Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm, have been synthesized. Rietveld profile analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data collected at room temperature reveal that the compounds possess a modified K2NiF4-type structure with orthorhombic cell symmetry formed by tilting of the ScO6 octahedra. Variable temperature (25\u20131200\u00a0\u00b0C) powder X-ray diffraction data show that at the highest temperatures the structures of LaSrScO4 and PrSrScO4 transform to the regular tetragonal K2NiF4-structure type but the degree of orthorhombicity (c/a) in the unit cells initially increases on heating for all materials, reaching a maximum near 300\u00a0\u00b0C. This structural behavior is analyzed in terms of relative ionic radii of the various lanthanides and scandium. A general structural model based on tolerance factors has been developed for the family of materials A2BO4 with various A and B cation sizes.",

The uptake of this Zn(II) complex in HeLa, MCF-7 and IGROV cancer cells was monitored by fluorescence microscopies (epi- and confocal fluorescence imaging). The radiolabelling to 64Cu(II) bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complex was performed cleanly by transmetallation from the corresponding Zn(II) species using 64Cu(OAc)2.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

These have the ability to recognise SWNTs from DMF\u2013toluene mixtures. HR TEM, TM AFM and SEM measurements showed that the hosts wrap around individual arc-made SWNTs, giving monodispersed composites in DMF which are stable for weeks. The dispersed composites were studied by Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies, including laser scanning confocal microscopy (for aggregates incorporated in cells). These porphyrin hosts encapsulate SWNTs based on \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 type interactions in an analogous manner to those observed by single crystal X-ray diffraction in their C60 complexes. These interactions may be further reinforced by porphyrin\u2013porphyrin stacking. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted the structure of the SWNT : porphyrin host complex or composite formed and the binding energies of tripodal porphyrin hosts in composites with either C60 or SWNT as guests.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Mixing of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 or a mixture of CHCl3 and MeOH (98\u22362) gave a pale yellow solution indicative of a very weak charge-transfer interaction. Upon addition of MX, brightly coloured solutions were obtained, resulting from a red shift and an increase in the intensity of the charge-transfer band.

    "abstract": "Copper bis(4-ethyl-3-thiosemicarbazonato) acenaphthenequinone (1) and copper bis(4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazonato) acenaphthenequinone (2) are synthesized and characterized in solution, in the solid state, and radiolabeled. Serum-protein binding radioassays show good stability in solution and about 25\u2009% binding to protein over 1\u2005h, which is comparable with the hypoxia selective tracer [64Cu(ATSM)]. Cyclic voltammetry shows fast and reversible reduction at redox potentials similar to the values known for hypoxia-selective copper compounds. However, despite this, complex 1 does not show any hypoxic-selective uptake in HeLa cells over 1-h standard assays. Possible reasons for this are studied by using the intrinsic fluorescence of the CuII complexes to determine the cellular distributions and uptake mechanism by confocal microscopy. The complexes are found to bind to the external cell membrane and disperse evenly in the cytoplasm only after a very slow cell internalization (>1\u2005h). No significant changes in distribution are observed by fluorescence imaging under hypoxic conditions. The rate of localization in the cytoplasm contrasts with their ZnII analogues, which are known to have fast cell uptake (up to 20\u2005min) and a clear localization in lysosomes and mitochondria. The cytotoxicity mechanism of 1 over 24\u2005h against a number of adherent cell lines is seen to be by membrane disruption and is of a comparable magnitude to that of [Cu(ATSM)], as demonstrated by methyl tetrazolium (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays.",

The larger cations cause a pinching of the S\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S contact, which is responsible for better orbital overlap between pz orbitals on neighboring S and C atoms. Density functional theory calculations show that these orbitals are critically involved in the valence band of these materials, such that modulation of the S\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S distance has an important effect on band dispersion and, implicitly, on the conductivity. The Cd analogue, with the largest cation and shortest S\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7S contact, shows the largest electrical conductivity, \u03c3 = 2.86 (\u00b10.53) \u00d7 10\u20134 S/cm, which is also among the highest in microporous MOFs.

    "abstract": " We apply the density functional theory + U (DFT+U) and unrestricted hybrid functional DFT-UB3LYP methods to study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of two prototypical iron porphines: iron(III) porphine chloride (FePCl) and difluoro iron(III\u2212IV) porphine. Plain DFT within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) implementation fails in describing the correct high-spin ground state of these porphine molecules, whereas DFT+U and UB3LYP provide an improved description. For a range of U values (4\u22128 eV), we compare the results of the DFT+U approach to those obtained previously with the hybrid functional (B3LYP) and with the CASPT2 approach. The DFT+U and UB3LYP methods successfully predict the molecular high spin (S = 5/2) ground state of FePCl, and also provide the nontrivial S = 3 high spin ground state for FePF2. For the latter six-coordinated Fe porphine, our DFT+U calculations show that the S = 2, S = 5/2, and S = 3 states are energetically very close together (differences of 30 meV). Nonetheless, S = 3 is obtained as the ground state of the whole molecule, in accordance with the spin expected from the electron count. Our DFT+U calculations show furthermore that the Fe 3d occupancy is similar for FePF2 and FePCl, i.e., DFT+U does not support Fe(IV) for FePF2, but rather an Fe(III) porphyrin \u03c0-cation radical species, with an Fe high spin SFe = 5/2, and an additional S = 1/2 stemming from spin density distributed over the porphine ring. This observation is also supported by our UB3LYP calculations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the polymorphism exhibited by organic active-pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), in particular the relationships between crystal structure and the thermodynamics of polymorph stability, is vital for the production of more stable drugs and better therapeutics, and for the economics of the pharmaceutical industry in general. In this article, we report a detailed study of the structure\u2013property relationships among the polymorphs of the model API, Sulfamerazine. Detailed experimental characterization using synchrotron radiation is complemented by computational modeling of the lattice dynamics and mechanical properties, in order to study the origin of differences in millability and to investigate the thermodynamics of the phase equilibria. Good agreement is observed between the simulated phonon spectra and mid-infrared and Raman spectra. The presence of slip planes, which are found to give rise to low-frequency lattice vibrations, explains the higher millability of Form I compared to Form II. Energy/volume curves for the three polymorphs, together with the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic free energy computed from the phonon frequencies, explains why Form II converts to Form I at high temperature, whereas Form III is a rare polymorph that is difficult to isolate. The combined experimental and theoretical approach employed here should be generally applicable to the study of other systems that exhibit polymorphism.Keywords:  Sulfamerazine; polymorphism; thermal expansion; lattice dynamics; phase transitions; synchrotron X-ray diffraction; slip planes",

A greater understanding of the lithium-ion transport mechanisms is important in optimising such oxide anodes. Here, stoichiometric LiVO2 and Li-rich Li1.07V0.93O2 are investigated using atomistic modelling techniques. Lithium-ion migration is not found in LiVO2, which has also previously shown to be resistant to lithium intercalation. Molecular dynamics simulations of lithiated non-stoichiometric Li1.07+yV0.93O2 suggest cooperative interstitial Li+ diffusion with favourable migration barriers and diffusion coefficients (DLi), which are facilitated by the presence of lithium in the transition metal layers; such transport behaviour is important for high rate performance as a battery anode.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the composition of the paints used on works of art is crucial in attributing them to the artist or workshop that created them, as well as to devising strategies for their preservation and restoration. Much current research is focussed on the development of non-invasive spectroscopic methods, enabling in situ paint analysis without the need for sampling. However, whilst a lot of work has been carried out on looking at the composition of artists' materials qualitatively, little has been performed to analyse them quantitatively. In this work, we investigate the use of Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, in isolation and in conjunction with complementary fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy, to look at the spectral changes that occur with varying the paint/binder ratio in model historic lead-based paints. When used in conjunction with multivariate analysis, we demonstrate that it can be possible to obtain a semi-quantitative estimation of the composition of a paint film from its Fourier transform Raman spectrum, given a set of suitable reference spectra recorded from paints produced within the workable mixture range. This represents a tentative first step towards a semi-automated and quantitative method for analysing cultural heritage objects, which may help boost our understanding of their history, and enable conservators to make more informed decisions so as to ensure their preservation.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe development of non-invasive analytical methods is of widespread interest to the field of conservation science, providing chemical insight into the materials used to create painted works of art, which can, for example, inform decisions about their restoration and preservation, or help discern original works from forgeries. A key undertaking in this area is to develop practical methods for identifying and understanding the chemical processes that occur in paint films under ageing. Furthermore, whereas a number of scientific studies have focussed on model systems in which natural ageing processes are simulated in a short time by irradiation under ultraviolet (UV) light, it remains to be established to what extent natural and accelerated ageing induce similar chemical changes. In this work, we employ FT-Raman spectroscopy, together with a simple spectral-deconvolution algorithm, to study in detail the spectral changes accompanying the natural and UV-accelerated ageing of lead-based paint films. We find that the two processes differ significantly, and that spectroscopic signatures, principally in the fluorescence background, can thus be used to differentiate the two modes of ageing and hence possibly to identify attempted forgeries. Our studies also suggest that paints based on proteinaceous binders are more stable to ageing than lipid-bound ones. Finally, we investigate the possibility of using our chemometric deconvolution technique, in conjunction with multivariate analysis, for the semi-automated characterisation of the degree or extent of ageing in unknown samples.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTankyrases-1 and -2 (TNKS-1 and TNKS-2) have three cellular roles which make them important targets in cancer. Using NAD+ as a substrate, they poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate TRF1 (regulating lengths of telomeres), NuMA (facilitating mitosis) and axin (in wnt/\u00ce\u00b2-catenin signalling). Using molecular modelling and the structure of the weak inhibitor 5-aminoiso quinolin-1-one, 3-aryl-5-substituted-isoquinolin-1-ones were designed as inhibitors to explore the structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) for binding and to define the shape of a hydrophobic cavity in the active site. 5-Amino-3-arylisoquinolinones were synthesised by Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling of arylboronic acids to 3-bromo-1-methoxy-5-nitro-isoquinoline, reduction and O-demethylation. 3-Aryl-5-methylisoquinolin-1-ones, 3-aryl-5-fluoroisoquinolin-1-ones and 3-aryl-5-methoxyisoquinolin-1-ones were accessed by deprotonation of 3-substituted-N,N,2-trimethylbenzamides and quench with an appropriate benzonitrile. SAR around the isoquinolinone core showed that aryl was required at the 3-position, optimally with a para-substituent. Small meta-substituents were tolerated but groups in the ortho-positions reduced or abolished activity. This was not due to lack of coplanarity of the rings, as shown by the potency of 4,5-dimethyl-3-phenylisoquinolin-1-one. Methyl and methoxy were optimal at the 5-position. SAR was rationalised by modelling and by crystal structures of examples with TNKS-2. The 3-aryl unit was located in a large hydrophobic cavity and the para-substituents projected into a tunnel leading to the exterior. Potency against TNKS-1 paralleled potency against TNKS-2. Most inhibitors were highly selective for TNKSs over PARP-1 and PARP-2. A range of highly potent and selective inhibitors is now available for cellular studies.",

ESR, IR and UV/VIS spectra are also reported for this compound and are consistent with the presence of discrete [Cu(OH)4]2\u2013 square planes. Thermal decomposition of this material proceeded by a complex multistage process via Sr2(OH)2Cu(OH)4, through CuO and Sr(OH)2, to Sr2CuO3 and CuO. Consideration of the structure of SrCu(OH)4\u00b7H2O shows that the relative orientation of the [Cu(OH)4]2\u2013 units is such that they do not crosslink to form infinite CuO2 sheets.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The AuNP-modified paper or textile was brought into \u201cweak\u201d (or non-permanent) contact with a glassy carbon electrode and immersed into aqueous electrolyte media. Electrochemical responses for the Fe(CN)64\u2212/Fe(CN)63\u2212 redox system in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 1.0\u00a0M KCl solutions were investigated by voltammetry and impedance methods. Even for weakly contacted AuNP catalysts of relatively low density faster electron transfer was observed. Particle sizes of at least 20\u00a0nm diameter were required. There was no permanent contact from AuNP catalysts to the electrode and the process was therefore termed \u201cweak contact catalysis\u201d. The method is proposed as a rapid and novel catalyst screening tool with potential applications in fuel cell and sensor technologies.",

The addition of low loadings of gold resulted in a significant improvement in catalyst performance both in terms of conversion and selectivity to lower (C2\u2013C4) olefins. Small loadings of indium proved highly effective for increasing CO2 conversion, whereas at higher loadings the selectivity to lower olefins could be dramatically increased. Catalysis tests involving palladium-promoted systems also proved successful with large increases in selectivity towards C5+ hydrocarbons observed. The catalysts were characterised by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, TEM and SEM, which confirmed the nanostructured nature of the catalytic species involved.",

    "abstract": "Recently, apatite-type germanates La9.33+xGe6O26+3x/2 have attracted considerable interest due to their high oxide ion conductivities. Research has shown that the key defects are oxide ion interstitials which lead to the conversion of some of the GeO4 units to GeO5. Consequently there has been a large interest in the preparation of high oxygen excess samples with high defect concentration. This strategy, however, leads to a reduction in symmetry from hexagonal to triclinic for x\u2009>\u20090.4, and consequently to reduced oxide ion conductivity at low temperatures. We present doping strategies to stabilise the hexagonal lattice, while maintaining high oxygen content. In particular, partial substitution of La by smaller rare earths (Y, Yb) is shown to be successful in preparing x\u2009=\u20090.67 samples with hexagonal symmetry and hence high\u00a0conductivities. In addition, doping on the Ge site with\u00a0Ti, Nb or W, has been shown to be similarly successful, leading to very high oxygen contents for W doping, e.g. La10Ge5.5W0.5O27.5. In the case of Ti doping, however, there\u00a0was some evidence for trapping of the interstitial oxide ions around the Ti. Preliminary results on the effect of\u00a0similar doping strategies on Pr, Nd germanates (Pr/Nd)9.33+xGe6O26+3x/2, are also discussed.",

This ammoniation was performed in situ on TOSCA beamline at ISIS, RAL, using anhydrous gaseous ammonia. The resulting material exhibits no pyrophoricity and much reduced air- and moisture-sensitivity compared to the bulk amide.

ZnII\u2013DPA(DPA = dipicolylamine)-appended phenylboronic acid 1\u00b7Zn forms an assembly with alizarin dye in MeOH\u201310 mM HEPES (1 : 1 v/v) containing 10 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 at 25 \u00b0C, in which the dye binds favorably to the coordinated zinc(II) in the ZnII\u2013DPA moiety. Addition of pyrophosphate (PPi) as a putative analyte causes reorganization of the complex to produce an alternative boronate ester assembly, which causes an increase in fluorescence, detectable by the naked eye. It is interesting to note that the system exhibited PPi-selectivity over other phosphates such as ATP (adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate), ADP (adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate), AMP (adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate) and Pi (inorganic phosphate); the competitive assay employed to determine the apparent association constants of 1\u00b7Zn with the anion analytes allows us to estimate that the binding with PPi [(1.6 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 106 M\u22121], is 10-fold and 84-fold higher than with ATP and ADP, respectively. The sensing mechanism of 1\u00b7Zn in the presence of alizarin dye is explored using pH titrations and structural information is obtained using NMR.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

One of these candidates is a cationic lipid that can form a supramolecular complex with DNA. We have been working in a series of aromatic diamine lipids with different tail length from C6 to C18: [N-(3,5-dialkylbenzyl)ethane-1,2-diamine, denoted DA] as such a lipid. The present paper describes the synthesis and the fundamental properties of DA. SAXS from DA solution showed bilayer vesicle formation, while it showed lamellar formation after the complexation with DNA. When we measured the N/P ratio (molar ratio of the amine groups (N) in DA to phosphate groups (P) in the DNA) dependence of SAXS, the lamellar peak (spacing = 5.0 nm) increased proportionally to the added DNA concentration at N/P \u2265 8. On the other hand, in the range of N/P < 8, the spacing was increased to 5.5 nm and the area decreased as DNA increased. These different features between N/P \u2265 8 and N/P < 8 suggest that the lamellar supramolecular structures differ according to the composition.\r",

    "abstract": " In situ near-IR transmittance measurements have been used to characterize the density of trapped electrons in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Measurements have been made under a range experimental conditions including during open-circuit photovoltage decay and during recording of the IV characteristic. The optical cross section of electrons at 940 nm was determined by relating the IR absorbance to the density of trapped electrons measured by charge extraction. The value, \u03c3n = 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221218 cm2, was used to compare the trapped electron densities in illuminated DSCs at open and short circuit in order to quantify the difference in the quasi Fermi level, \u0394nEF under the two conditions. It was found that \u0394nEF for the cells studied was 250 meV over wide range of illumination intensities. IR transmittance measurements have also been used to quantify shifts in conduction band energy associated with dye adsorption.",

Boronic acids recognise diol motifs through boronic ester formation and interact with anions generating boronates, as such they have been exploited in sensing and separation protocols for diol appended molecules such as saccharides and anions alike. Therefore robust molecular sensors with the capacity to detect chosen molecules selectively and signal their presence continues to attract substantial attention, and boronic acids have been exploited with some success to monitor the presence of various analytes. Reversible boronic acid-diol interactions have also been exploited in boronaffinity chromatography realising new separation domains through the same binding events. Boronic acid diol and anion interactions pertaining to sensing and separation are surveyed.     \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Bi2TiO4F2 and Bi2NbO5F adopt a single layer Aurivillius-type structure with an ordered array of fluoride/oxide anions. The structure of Bi2TiO4F2 has also been studied at 24 K using time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction, which is well below the previously reported ferroelectric transition temperature. The structures of both materials can be described in the tetragonal space group I4/mmm, but show significant atomic displacements from the positions described in the original structural models proposed for these compounds as a result of disordered tilts and/or distortions of the M(O,F)6 octahedra. No three-dimensional long-range ordered structural distortion was observed upon cooling of Bi2TiO4F2 to 24 K. 19F MAS NMR data have been collected and support the presence of only one fluoride site. Bond valence calculations allow the assignment of the oxide and fluoride ions within the structure, and the proposed model has the fluoride ions located in the equatorial sites of the titanium or niobium octahedra.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The interplay between Na and Cs cations in directing formation of zeolite RHO is the main focus of this study. Depending on the ratio of Na and Cs in the precursor gel, with no organic structure directing agents, several different zeolites form during synthesis. This indicates that pure zeolite RHO can only be obtained at a very specific Cs to Na ratio. More generally, this may shed light on the bigger question of how zeolite pores form in the absence of organic structure directing agents.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

XPS data confirm monolayer grafting after electrochemical anodization in pure KolliphorEL. On the basis of voltammetry and impedance measurements, the charge transfer process for the Fe(CN)63\u2013/4\u2013 probe molecule is completely blocked after KolliphorEL grafting and in the absence of a \u201cguest\u201d. However, in the presence of low concentrations of suitable ferrocene derivatives as guests, mediated electron transfer across the monolayer via a shuttle mechanism is observed. The resulting amplification of the ferrocene electroanalytical signal is investigated systematically and compared for five ferrocene derivatives. The low-concentration electron shuttle efficiency decreases in the following sequence: (dimethylaminomethyl)ferrocene > n-butyl ferrocene > ferrocene dimethanol > ferroceneacetonitrile > ferroceneacetic acid.Keywords:  Cremophor; PEGylation; amplification; voltammetry; tunneling; sensor",

    "abstract": "This work reports the preparation of ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles by sonochemically enhanced borohydride reduction of precursor lithium tetrachloroaurate (LiAuCl4) incorporated into the core of polymeric micelles formed from amphiphilic copolymers of polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The copolymers were prepared with varying styrene block lengths from a PEO macroinitiator by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). UV/visible spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of elemental gold. The effect of sonication time on the appearance of the gold nanoparticles was determined and showed that the absorbance first increased as the nanoparticles formed but decreased at longer times, presumably as a result of a degree of agglomeration. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the morphology of the nanocomposites which confirmed that micellar polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide is an excellent vehicle for the formation of well-defined films containing nanoparticulate gold. However, we report for the first time that care must be taken to optimize the preparation time to obtain the desired particle sizes because this parameter is very sensitive to the duration over which sonication is carried out.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCatalytic ozonation has recently gained significant attention as an effective process used for the removal of organics from water. Unfortunately, despite increasing research efforts in the field of catalytic ozonation and the introduction of new catalysts, the mechanisms of catalytic processes are still largely unknown. An understanding of the mechanisms of catalytic ozonation is vital in order to introduce this technique in water treatment at an industrial scale. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to provide a short overview of catalytic processes, their recent advances and to identify major directions taken to understand mechanisms governing catalytic processes utilised in water and wastewater treatment. Catalytic ozonation is considered to belong to Advanced Oxidation Processes. However, the results published by several research groups indicate that not all catalytic processes utilise the power of hydroxyl radicals.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of block copolymers is of great interest due to their abilities to self-assemble into a variety of structured, ordered, or partially ordered morphologies, and because they have number of applications. Three samples of poly(styrene)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) were synthesized by employed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique and using monofunctional PEO-macroinitiator (mPEO-F) as starting material. The composition of the copolymer was obtained through NMR spectroscopy, whereas the molecular mass and degree of dispersity from light scattering and GPC/SEC. The CMC was obtained from the dependence of hydrodynamic radius (RH) over the concentration and found that it was decreased with contents of polystyrene and temperature. The RH dependence also indicated that shape of micelles change after certain concentration of copolymer. The reduced viscosity data plotted against concentration did not show a simple straight line as expected in case of polymers; rather, its slope was changed at a particular concentration, indicating sudden variation in the self-assembling behavior of the copolymers. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) results of the material indicated the morphology pattern of two-dimensional arrays of hexagons with holes.",

    "abstract": "The extremely surface sensitive technique of metastable de-excitation spectroscopy (MDS) has been utilized to probe the bonding and reactivity of crotyl alcohol over Pd(111) and provide insight into the selective oxidation pathway to crotonaldehyde. Auger de-excitation (AD) of metastable He (23S) atoms reveals distinct features associated with the molecular orbitals of the adsorbed alcohol, corresponding to emission from the hydrocarbon skeleton, the O n nonbonding, and C\u2550C \u03c0 states. The O n and C\u2550C \u03c0 states of the alcohol are reversed when compared to those of the aldehyde. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the alcohol show that an adsorption mode with both C\u2550C and O bonds aligned somewhat parallel to the surface is energetically favored at a substrate temperature below 200 K. Density of states calculations for such configurations are in excellent agreement with experimental MDS measurements. MDS revealed oxidative dehydrogenation of crotyl alcohol to crotonaldehyde between 200 and 250 K, resulting in small peak shifts to higher binding energy. Intramolecular changes lead to the opposite assignment of the first two MOs in the alcohol versus the aldehyde, in accordance with DFT and UPS studies of the free molecules. Subsequent crotonaldehyde decarbonylation and associated propylidyne formation above 260 K could also be identified by MDS and complementary theoretical calculations as the origin of deactivation and selectivity loss. Combining MDS and DFT in this way represents a novel approach to elucidating surface catalyzed reaction pathways associated with a \u201creal-world\u201d practical chemical transformation, namely the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this paper we demonstrate the electrodeposition of nickel, a common ferromagnetic material, in various magnetically desirable shapes including nanowires, nanoparticles and highly faceted shells. In order to obtain three dimensional mesostructures, the electrochemical deposition of nickel was performed on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) under different electrolyte composition and deposition potential conditions. Under potentiostatic deposition at one distinct potential negative with respect to the reversible potential of nickel, three stages of nucleation and growth take place leading to a complex morphology of deposits. However, dual-pulse potential deposition and electrodeposition in low pH solutions causing hydrogen evolution, lead to nickel deposits in the form of nanowires and nanoparticles with the complete absence of a faceted morphology. Highly faceted nickel shells were electrodeposited via a dual-bath method on prefabricated silver mesocrystals as 'template' electrodeposited on HOPG. Magnetic properties of faceted three dimensional nickel shells reveal clear signatures of facets of mesocrystals in the form of sharp steps in measured hysteresis loops and a strong magnetic anisotropy with respect to applied field direction.",

Single crystal X-ray structures of M1, M2 and Me3Si-C\u2261C-4-C6H4-C6H4-4-C\u2261C-SiMe3 were determined with a view to obtain a better understanding of the molecular and intermolecular interactions in the solid state which has been used to explain the optical properties of the polymers derived from them. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the polymers, P1, P2 and P5 showed that the lowest energy band is blue shifted due to the introduction of biphenylene fragments into the alkoxy substituted poly(ethynylenephenylene)s.",

In agreement with experimental data, the reduced (110) surface shows an occupied defect state 0.7 eV below the bottom of the conduction band. The other reduced surfaces also show defect states in the band gap, with the defect state energies being strongly dependent on the choice of surface, and following the trend expected from crystal field arguments. For all the reduced surfaces, the excess charge associated with the defect states is primarily localized on two Ti sites neighboring the vacancy, formally reducing these to TiIII. For the (101) and (001) surfaces these Ti sites are geometrically inequivalent, and the corresponding gap states are separated in energy. Vacancy formation energies vary as \u0394Evac(100) > \u0394Evac(110) > \u0394Evac(001) > \u0394Evac(101). The variation in vacancy formation energy and gap state energies suggests potential differences between the surfaces in catalytic behavior for adsorbed reactant molecules.",

    "abstract": " The formations of intrinsic n-type defects, that is, oxygen vacancies and titanium interstitials, in rutile and anatase TiO2 have been compared using GGA+U calculations. In both crystal structures, these defects give rise to states in the band gap, corresponding to electrons localized at Ti3+ centers. O vacancy formation in rutile results in two excess electrons occupying 3d orbitals on Ti atoms neighboring the vacancy. Similarly, for anatase, two Ti 3d orbitals are occupied by the excess electrons, with one of these Ti sites neighboring the vacancy, and the second at a next-nearest Ti position. This localization is accompanied by one oxygen moving toward the vacancy site to give a \u201csplit vacancy\u201d geometry. A second fully localized solution is also found for anatase, with both occupied Ti sites neighboring the vacancy site. This minimum is 0.05 eV less stable than the split vacancy and is thus expected to be present in experimental samples. A partially delocalized solution corresponding to the split vacancy geometry, with one electron occupying the bottom of the conduction band, is also identified as 0.28 eV less stable. Formation of titanium interstitials donates four electrons to the Ti lattice. In anatase, one of these electrons is located at the interstitial Ti site, and three occupied defect states are hybridized between three nearest neighbor Ti sites. In rutile, these excess electrons are mostly localized at four nearest neighbor Ti sites, with only a small amount of excess charge found on the interstitial Ti atom. This difference in the charge on the interstitial atom is a consequence of the differing interstitial geometries in the two polymorphs. Calculated optical absorption spectra for all defects show significant decreases of the optical band gap, with a larger red shift predicted for titanium interstitials in anatase than in rutile. Defect formation energies have been calculated under oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions for both polymorphs. Under all conditions, O vacancy formation is slightly more favorable in anatase than in rutile, while Ti interstitials form more easily in rutile than anatase. Under O-rich conditions, O vacancies are the favored defect type, but both defect types have high formation energies. Under O-poor conditions, both defect types are stabilized, with Ti interstitials predicted to become the favored defect in rutile samples, particularly at elevated temperatures.",

Standard DFT functionals (LDA, GGA) predict that for doped anatase TiO2 the excess charge occupies the bottom of the conduction band, and is delocalised over all the Ti atoms. This has previously been proposed as the source of the experimentally observed high conductivity. GGA predicts a similar metallic system for Nb-doped rutile, however, in contradiction with experimental data that characterise doped rutile as a semiconductor with a localised gap state. This demonstrates that standard DFT functionals cannot explain the difference in experimental behaviour between polymorphs. Supplementing GGA with a \u201c+ U\u201d on-site Coulomb correction recovers an electronic structure for Nb-doped rutile TiO2 that is in agreement with the experimental data; a localised gap state is seen, corresponding to a small polaron on a single Ti site. GGA + U also predicts a small-polaronic Ti3+ gap state within a semiconducting system for {Nb,Ta}-doped anatase. On this basis we suggest the experimental variance between polymorphs in doped thin films is not an inherent property of the bulk crystals, but is due to other factors, e.g. additional defects or sample morphology, dependent on the synthesis history. For both anatase and rutile the defect feature is found to be insensitive to the identity of the dopant, and similar Ti3+ polarons are expected generally for doping where electrons are donated to the Ti lattice.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

This behaviour arises from the self-interaction error inherent to standard density functionals, and is demonstrated by both p- and n-type systems where the defect state is a small polaron associated with host lattice atoms. An approximate correction is to describe the electron\u2014electron interactions in the orbitals of interest within the DFT+U formalism. This gives improved descriptions for systems where the states of interest are well represented by atomic-like orbitals.  The qualitative failure of standard DFT and corresponding improvement achieved with DFT+U is illustrated for cases where the defect state is primarily associated with localised cation f and d states (O vacancies in CeO2 and TiO2) and anion p states (Li-doped MgO).

    "abstract": "AbstractExperimental observations indicate that removing bridging oxygen atoms from the TiO2 rutile (1\u00a01\u00a00) surface produces a localised state approximately 0.7\u00a0eV below the conduction band. The corresponding excess electron density is thought to localise on the pair of Ti atoms neighbouring the vacancy; formally giving two Ti3+ sites. We consider the electronic structure and geometry of the oxygen deficient TiO2 rutile (1\u00a01\u00a00) surface using both gradient-corrected density functional theory (GGA DFT) and DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (GGA\u00a0+\u00a0U) to allow a direct comparison of the two methods. We show that GGA fails to predict the experimentally observed electronic structure, in agreement with previous uncorrected DFT calculations on this system. Introducing the +U term encourages localisation of the excess electronic charge, with the qualitative distribution depending on the value of U. For low values of U (\u00e2\u00a9\u00bd4.0\u00a0eV) the charge localises in the sub-surface layers occupied in the GGA solution at arbitrary Ti sites, whereas higher values of U (\u00e2\u00a9\u00be4.2\u00a0eV) predict strong localisation with the excess electronic charge mainly on the two Ti atoms neighbouring the vacancy. The precise charge distribution for these larger U values is found to differ from that predicted by previous hybrid-DFT calculations.",

    "abstract": "We have used density-functional theory [generalized gradient approximation (GGA)] to study lithium intercalation at low concentration into anatase ${\\text{TiO}}_{2}$. To describe the defect states produced by Li doping a Hubbard ``$+U$'' correction is applied to the $\\text{Ti}\\text{ }d$ states $(\\text{GGA}+U)$. Uncorrected GGA calculations predict ${\\text{Li}}_{x}{\\text{TiO}}_{2}$ to be metallic with the excess charge distributed over all Ti sites, whereas $\\text{GGA}+U$ predicts a defect state 0.96 eV below the conduction band, in agreement with experimental photoelectron spectra. This occupied defect state corresponds to charge strongly localized at a single $\\text{Ti}\\text{ }3d$ site neighboring the intercalated lithium with a magnetization of $1\\text{ }\\ensuremath{\\mu}\\text{B}$. This polaronic state produces a redshifted optical absorption spectrum, which is compared to those for the native O-vacancy and Ti-interstitial defects. The strong localization of charge at a single Ti center lowers the symmetry of the interstitial geometry relative to that predicted by GGA. The intercalated lithium sits close to the center of the octahedral site, occupying a single potential energy minimum with respect to displacement along the [001] direction. This challenges the previous interpretation of neutron diffraction data that there exist two potential energy minima separated by $1.6\\text{ }\\text{\\AA{}}$ along the [001] direction within each octahedron. Nudged elastic band calculations give barriers to interoctahedral diffusion of $\\ensuremath{\\sim}0.6\\text{ }\\text{eV}$, in good agreement with experimental data. These barrier heights are found to depend only weakly on the position of the donated electron. The intercalation energy is 2.14 eV with GGA and 1.88 eV with $\\text{GGA}+U$, compared to the experimental value of $\\ensuremath{\\sim}1.9\\text{ }\\text{eV}$. Li-electron binding energies have also been calculated. The $[{\\text{Li}}_{\\text{i}}^{\\ifmmode\\bullet\\else\\textbullet\\fi{}}{\\text{-Ti}}_{\\text{Ti}}^{\\ensuremath{'}}]$ complex has a binding energy of 56 meV, and a second electron is predicted to be bound to give $[{\\text{Li}}_{\\text{i}}^{\\ifmmode\\bullet\\else\\textbullet\\fi{}}\\text{\\ensuremath{-}}2{\\text{Ti}}_{\\text{Ti}}^{\\ensuremath{'}}]$ with a stabilization energy of 30 meV, indicating that intercalated lithium will weakly trap excess electrons produced during photoillumination or introduced by additional $n$-type doping.",

Phase transitions to the rocksalt (B1) phase were confirmed by examining calculated powder diffraction patterns, which show the same changes in features as seen for experimental systems. By directly observing the atomic trajectories throughout the duration of the transition the local mechanism has been identified. The transition proceeds via a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate, denoted as the h-MgO structure. It is initiated by a single nucleation event at a [110]B4 surface with subsequent growth of the B1 region throughout the remainder of the nanocrystal. The consequences of this mechanism for the particle shape of the product phase are detailed and contrasted with those previously found for initially zincblende (B3) structured nanoparticles, using the same interaction potential.

The ionic conductivities and Ag+\u00a0diffusion coefficients vary as \u03b2\u00a0>\u00a07H\u00a0\u2248\u00a09R\u00a0\u2248\u00a010L\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b3. The \u03b2|\u03b3-heterostructured polytypes show no enhancement in defect populations or Ag+\u00a0mobilities relative to the \u03b2-AgI phase, and instead behave as simple composites of \u03b2- and \u03b3-AgI. This contradicts the proposal that the extreme conductivity enhancement observed for 7H and 9R polytypes is explained by extensive space-charge formation. ",

    "abstract": "The dynamical properties of ionic melts formed from mixtures of LiCl and KCl have been studied across the full composition range in computer simulations of sufficient length to enable reliable values for such collective transport coefficients as the viscosity,conductivity, and internal mobilities to be determined reliably. Interest centers on the nontrivial concentration dependence exhibited by these transport coefficients, which agrees well with that observed experimentally, and in relating this to the strength of the association between an ion and its first coordination shell. The relationships between the various transport coefficients, such as those between the diffusion coefficient and the viscosity (Stokes\u2013Einstein) and the conductivity (Nernst\u2013Einstein) also exhibit composition dependences that reflect this association. The connection between the internal mobility and two measures of the coordination shell dynamics (the cage relaxation time and the self-exchange velocity) is explored; it is shown that the self-exchange velocity follows the composition and temperature dependence of the internal mobility very well. Finally, it is shown that allowing for anion polarization in the interaction model increases the mobility of all species without changing the structure of the melt discernibly, with the largest effect being found for the  <mml:math> <mml:msup> <mml:mi>Li</mml:mi> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>+</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:math>  ion.",

The presence in the furan diene of a susbtituent at the 3-position bearing an atom with lone-pair electrons propitiates the coordination of a metallic atom by the sulfoxide and the R3 \u201cligand\u201d group. This chelation effect, together with the stereoelectronic demand of the R3 and sulfoxide groups, considerably decreases the degree of conformational freedom of the diene moiety in the cyclic transition state leading to the observed stereoselectivity. By choosing appropriate substituents in the furan ring, it is possible to obtain 100:0 cis-trans and 100:0 endo-exo diastereoselectivities. Up to 100\u2009% \u03c0-facial diastereoselectivity (enantioselectivity after removal of the sulfoxide group) could be reached. Yields lie within the range of 50\u201380\u2009%, depending on the furan substrate. However, if the furan diene is fitted with deactivating electron-withdrawing substituents, low conversions were observed under certain reaction conditions, but always with excellent-to-complete chemo- and stereoselectivities.

This type of structure is an interesting synthetic building block for potential bioactive molecules and it was prepared from 8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one having a NHBoc function on C-1. This precursor was obtained by a [4+3] cycloaddition reaction of 2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminofuran and the oxyallyl cation generated in situ from 2,4-dibromo-3-pentanone. Reduction of the carbonyl group at C-3 was accomplished in high yield and stereoselective manner to afford the corresponding axial alcohol at C-3 as a major product. Further intramolecular haloetherification of this type of alcohols with NBS and I(py)2BF4 led to the corresponding bromo and iodo-derivatives at C-8 of the 2,6-dioxatricyclo[3.3.1.03,7]nonane framework, in high yield.

    "abstract": "The influence of water on the redox properties of ceria is pivotal to its widespread exploitation spanning a variety of applications. Ab initio simulation techniques based on DFT-GGA+U are used to investigate the water\u2013ceria system including associative (H2O) and dissociative (\u2212OH) adsorption/desorption of water and the formation of oxygen vacancies in the presence of water vapor on the stoichiometric and reduced low index surfaces of ceria at different water coverages. Our calculations address the controversy concerning the adsorption of water on the CeO2{111}, and new results are reported for the CeO2{110} and {100} surfaces. The simulations reveal strong water coverage dependence for dissociatively (\u2212OH) adsorbed water on stoichiometric surfaces which becomes progressively destabilized at high coverage, while associative (H2O) adsorption depends weakly on the coverage due to weaker interactions between the adsorbed molecules. Analysis of the adsorption geometries suggests that the surface cerium atom coordination controls the strong adhesion of water as the average distance Ce\u2013OW is always 10% greater than the Ce\u2013O distance in the bulk, while the hydrogen bonding network dictates the orientation of the molecules. The adsorption energy is predicted to increase on reduced surfaces because oxygen vacancies act as active sites for water dissociation. Crucially, by calculating the heat of reduction of dry and wet surfaces, we also show that water promotes further reduction of ceria surfaces and is therefore central to its redox chemistry. Finally, we show how these simulation approaches can be used to evaluate water desorption as a function of temperature and pressure which accords well with experimental data for CeO2{111}. We predict desorption temperatures (TD) for CeO2{110} and CeO2{100} surfaces, where experimental data are not yet available. Such an understanding will help experiment interpret the complex surface/interface redox processes of ceria, which will, inevitably, include water.",

The formation of the new triphosphaallyl moiety \u03b73-P3{P(O)H} was determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy, and confirmed in the solid state by a single-crystal X-ray structure of the stable product [Ir(\u03ba2-dppm)(\u03ba1-dppm)(\u03b73-P3{P(O)H})] (2).

The mechanism of the reaction was investigated at the DFT level, which suggested a selective attack of an in-situ generated OH\u2212 anion on one of the non-coordinated phosphorus atoms of the P4 moiety.

    "abstract": "Here we show that transport-generated phase separation at the air\u2013liquid interface in systems containing self-assembling amphiphilic molecules and polymers can be controlled by the relative humidity (RH) of the air. We also show that our observations can be described quantitatively with a theoretical model describing interfacial phase separation in a water gradient that we published previously. These phenomena arises from the fact that the water chemical potential corresponding to the ambient RH will, in general, not match the water chemical potential in the open aqueous solution. This implies nonequilibrium conditions at the air\u2013water interface, which in turn can have consequences on the molecular organization in this layer. The experimental setup is such that we can control the boundary conditions in RH and thereby verify the predictions from the theoretical model. The polymer\u2013surfactant systems studied here are composed of polyethylenimine (PEI) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB). Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering results show that interfacial phases with hexagonal or lamellar structure form at the interface of dilute polymer\u2013surfactant micellar solutions. From spectroscopic ellipsometry data we conclude that variations in RH can be used to control the growth of micrometer-thick interfacial films and that reducing RH leads to thicker films. For the CTAB\u2013PEI system, we compare the phase behavior of the interfacial phase to the equilibrium bulk phase behavior. The interfacial film resembles the bulk phases formed at high surfactant to polymer ratio and reduced water contents, and this can be used to predict the composition of interfacial phase. We also show that convection in the vapor phase strongly reduces film formation, likely due to reduction of the unstirred layer, where diffusive transport is dominating.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays over 150\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm long have been grown by catalytic chemical vapour deposition on the walls of bare cordierite monoliths in a single step. The method described avoids the need for the multiple pre-treatment steps currently applied, and is coupled with an increase in the thickness of the carbon layer obtained by an order of magnitude compared to literature. Uniform CNT growth has been obtained over different lengths of monolith. The resulting CNT/cordierite monoliths have a high surface area and low pressure drop, making them a viable support for use in industrial catalysis.",

On partial reduction to CaMnO2.75, oxygen vacancies order in a zig\u2013zag arrangement and a further reduction to CaMnO2.5, is predicted to form a brownmillerite-like structure. We found that reduced structures have a large volume expansion which can be related to the formation of domains and cracking in experimental samples. On calculating the thermoelectric properties, we found that the partially reduced structures have more favourable Seebeck coefficients compared to the highly reduced structures. The structures can also be separated into two classes based on the resistivity showing low or high resistance depending on the oxygen vacancies arrangement and content. However none of the intrinsically doped structures shows enhanced power factors and ZT.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis work describes our studies on the molecular design of interfacial architectures suitable for DNA sensing which could resist non-specific binding of nanomaterials commonly used as labels for amplifying biorecognition events. We observed that the non-specific binding of bio-nanomaterials to surface-confined oligonucleotide strands is highly dependent on the characteristics of the interfacial architecture. Thiolated double stranded oligonucleotide arrays assembled on Au surfaces evidence significant fouling in the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) at the nanomolar level. The non-specific interaction between the oligonucleotide strands and the nanomaterials can be sensitively minimized by introducing streptavidin (SAv) as an underlayer conjugated to the DNA arrays. The role of the SAv layer was attributed to the significant hydrophilic repulsion between the SAv-modified surface and the nanomaterials in close proximity to the interface, thus conferring outstanding anti-fouling characteristics to the interfacial architecture. These results provide a simple and straightforward strategy to overcome the limitations introduced by the non-specific binding of labels to achieve reliable detection of DNA-based biorecognition events.",

Certain synthetic metal-based nanomaterials, e.g. gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, are already in clinical use or under advanced preclinical investigations following in vitro and in vivo preclinical imaging success. We surveyed the recent publications landscape including those reported metallic nanoparticles having established applications in vivo, as well as some of the new metallic nanoparticles which, despite their potential as cancer nanodiagnostics, are currently awaiting in vivo evaluation. The objective of this review is to highlight the current metallic nanoparticles and/or alloys as well as their derivatives with multimodal imaging potential, focusing on their chemistry as a springboard to discussing their role in the future of nanomedicines design. We also highlight here some of the fundamentals of molecular and nano-imaging techniques of relevance to the metal-based colloids, alloys and metallic nanoparticles discerning their future prospects as cancer nanodiagnostics. The current approaches for metallic and alloy surface derivatisation, aiming to achieve functional and biocompatible materials for multimodal bioimaging applications, are discussed in order to bring about some new perspectives on the efficiency of metallic nanoparticles as synthetic scaffolds for imaging probe design and forecast their future use in medical imaging techniques (optical, CT, PET, SPECT and MRI).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The phenomenon can be explained due to a facile surface hydrolysis of Co-MOF-71 microcrystals in alkaline aqueous media via \u201cconformal\u201d transformation into a porous cobalt hydroxide. The resulting volume decrease during transformation of the MOF precursor (without a significant change in shape) is beneficial and ensures formation of a more active porous cobalt hydroxide product with high pseudo capacitance and electrocatalytic activity. The high \u201cmolecular scale porosity\u201d of the MOF precursor offers benefits due to conformal transformation into products with high \u201cnano-scale porosity\u201d.",

Weights of Hartree\\char21{}Fock (HF) exchange in the range from 30% to 100% are used.

These have been used for the catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons, showing superior properties than the powder form. The monolith-supported structure also overcomes limitations of the powder catalyst, such as high-pressure drops and potential toxicity of airborne CNT powders, that have, so-far, limited its use in industry.

Electrochemical anodization of zinc foil allows rapid formation of high aspect ratio ZnO nanowires under mild reaction conditions compared to more common fabrication methods. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, how 3D hierarchical ZnO nanowire structures can be fabricated by controlling the type of electrolyte and anodization voltage, temperature and time. Optimization of the reaction conditions yields growth rates of up to 3.2 \u03bcm min\u22121 and the controlled formation of aligned arrays of nanowires, flower-like nanostructures, and hierarchical, fractal nanowire structures. Annealing of the nanowires produces high surface area (55 m2 g\u22121) nanowires with slit-type pores perpendicular to the nanowire axis. In depth analysis of the anodization process allows us to propose the likely growth mechanisms at work during anodization. The findings presented here not only contribute to our knowledge of the interesting area of zinc anodization, but also enable researchers to design complex hierarchical structures for use in areas such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and sensing.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical processes in mesoporous TiO2-Nafion thin films deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes are inherently complex and affected by capacitance, Ohmic iR-drop, RC-time constant phenomena, and by potential and pH-dependent conductivity. In this study, large-amplitude sinusoidally modulated voltammetry (LASMV) is employed to provide access to almost purely Faradaic-based current data from second harmonic components, as well as capacitance and potential domain information from the fundamental harmonic for mesoporous TiO2-Nafion film electrodes. The LASMV response has been investigated with and without an immobilized one-electron redox system, ferrocenylmethyltrimethylammonium+. Results clearly demonstrate that the electron transfer associated with the immobilized ferrocene derivative follows two independent pathways i) electron hopping within the Nafion network and ii) conduction through the TiO2 backbone. The pH effect on the voltammetric response for the TiO2 reduction pathway (ii) can be clearly identified in the 2nd harmonic LASMV response with the diffusion controlled ferrocene response (i) acting as a pH independent reference. Application of second harmonic data derived from LASMV measurement, because of the minimal contribution from capacitance currents, may lead to reference-free pH sensing with systems like that found for ferrocene derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Published X-ray crystallographic structures for glycoside hydrolases (GHs) from 39 different families are surveyed according to some rigorous selection criteria, and the distances separating 208 pairs of catalytic carboxyl groups (20 \u03b1-retaining, 87 \u03b2-retaining, 38 \u03b1-inverting, and 63 \u03b2-inverting) are analyzed. First, the average of all four inter-carboxyl O\u2026O distances for each pair is determined; second, the mean of all the pair-averages within each GH family is determined; third, means are determined for groups of GH families. No significant differences are found for free structures compared with those complexed with a ligand in the active site of the enzyme, nor for \u03b1-GHs as compared with \u03b2-GHs. The mean and standard deviation (1\u03c3) of the unimodal distribution of average O\u2026O distances for all families of inverting GHs is 8\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00c5, with a very wide range from 5\u00c5 (GH82) to nearly 13\u00c5 (GH46). The distribution of average O\u2026O distances for all families of retaining GHs appears to be bimodal: the means and standard deviations of the two groups are 4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u00c5 and 6.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00c5. These average values are more representative, and more likely to be meaningful, than the often-quoted literature values, which are based on a very small sample of structures. The newly-updated average values proposed here may alter perceptions about what separations between catalytic residues are \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal\u201d for GHs.

It was found that both blood serum and HSA showed specific binding to vesicles which contained cholesterol, resulting in increased membrane permeability and release of encapsulated fluorescent dye. This effect was not seen with heat inactivated blood serum, heat inactivated HSA or in vesicles not containing cholesterol. These results suggest that HSA may have a physiological role over and beyond that of fatty acid carrier, possibly acting to regulate vascular endothelial cell cholesterol concentration.",

The acid derivatives in both series (C2N2S23 and S2COEt 6) were used as a photosensitizer in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), overall efficiency (\u00ce\u00b7) and kinetics of the dye/TiO2 system were investigated. It was found that 6 gave a higher efficiency cell than 3 despite the latter dye's more favorable electronic properties, such as greater absorption range, higher molar extinction coefficient and large degree of delocalization of the HOMO. The transient absorption spectroscopy studies revealed that the recombination kinetics of 3 were unexpectedly fast, which was attributed to the terminal CN on the ligand binding to the TiO2, as evidenced by an absorption study of R\u00a0=\u00a0H and CO2Et dyes sensitized on TiO2, and hence leading to a lower efficiency DSSC.",

The complexes were characterised by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, hybrid DFT and TD-DFT (time-dependent density-functional theory) calculations, EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance), emission spectroscopy and UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry, with the latter showing reversible conversion to the mono- and di-oxidised and mono- and di-reduced species. The data suggest the first oxidation to be largely based on the Ru centre but with little energetic difference between the highest occupied orbitals based on Ru and based on Cu. There was also evidence of solvent coordination in both the electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry experiments. The redox potentials and the strongvisible absorptions of 2 (\u03bbmax = 562 nm, \u03f5max = 22200 M\u20131\u2009cm\u20131)make it appropriate for study as a sensitiser in a dye-sensitised solar cell. Charge-separated lifetime of photoexcited 2 on TiO2 and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength were studied and are discussed alongside the formation of dye-sensitised solar cells with the best efficiency achieved of \u03b7 = 2.55\u2009%, Voc = 608 mV, Isc = 5.84 mA\u2009cm\u20132 and ff = 0.72. Limitations to the maximum efficiency obtained were attributed to a mismatch between the bipyridyl-based unoccupied orbital of the dye and the TiO2 conduction band edge.",

    "abstract": "1,4-Butanediol is able to deliver two equivalents of H2 in hydrogen-transfer reactions to ketones, imines, and alkenes. Unlike simple alcohols, which establish equilibrium in the reduction of ketones, 1,4-butanediol acts essentially irreversibly owing to the formation of butyrolactone, which acts as a thermodynamic sink. It is therefore not necessary to use 1,4-butanediol in great excess in order to achieve reduction reactions. In addition, allylic alcohols are reduced to saturated alcohols through an isomerization/reduction sequence using a ruthenium catalyst with 1,4-butanediol as the reducing agent. Imines and alkenes are also reduced under similar conditions.",

    "abstract": "The basal surfaces of phyllosilicate minerals have been widely studied, whereas the edge surfaces have received little attention. However, in order to simulate complete clay particles at the atomic level, the modeling of edge surfaces becomes crucially important, and such surfaces are likely to be far more active. We used a combination of quantum and potential based techniques to evaluate the structure of the edge surfaces of pyrophyllite and their interaction in an aqueous environment. These include {110}, {100}, {010}, {1\u030510}, {130}, and {1\u030530}. We found that the CLAYFF force field is an effective model for reproducing the DFT results. Furthermore, the results show that, for this notorious natural hydrophobic clay, all edge surfaces show hydrophilic behavior and that the precise structure of water above these surfaces is influenced by both the presence of hydroxyl groups and under-coordinated surface Al atoms; this will impact both geological processes where natural clays are involved and processes where such clays act as primary retention barriers to the dispersion of contaminants.",

    "abstract": " We have applied a combination of spectroscopic and diffraction methods to study the adduct formed between squaric acid and bypridine, which has been postulated to exhibit proton transfer associated with a single-crystal to single-crystal phase transition at ca. 450 K. A combination of X-ray single-crystal and very-high flux powder neutron diffraction data confirmed that a proton does transfer from the acid to the base in the high-temperature form. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated that the transition was reversible but that a significant kinetic energy barrier must be overcome to revert to the original structure. Computational modeling is consistent with these results. Modeling also revealed that, while the proton transfer event would be strongly discouraged in the gas phase, it occurs in the solid state due to the increase in charge state of the molecular ions and their arrangement inside the lattice. The color change is attributed to a narrowing of the squaric acid to bipyridine charge-transfer energy gap. Finally, evidence for the possible existence of two further phases at high pressure is also presented.",

The interatomic potential model successfully reproduces the observed tetragonal scheelite-type structure of LaNbO4. Formation of an oxygen vacancy, required for protonation, is accompanied by significant local relaxation leading to an [Nb2O7]4\u2212 group. The most favorable dopant solution energies are found for Ca2+ and Sr2+ on the La site. Dopant-vacancy association is predicted to occur for a wide range of divalent dopants on the La site and tetravalent dopants on the Nb site. Dopant-proton association is also predicted to occur for the range of dopants studied.

    "abstract": "A synthetic biological sensor was developed to monitor the interaction of plasma with soft, hydrated biological material. It comprises phospholipid vesicles in a hydrated proteinaceous environment comprising 5% (w/v) gelatin. The vesicles contained a self-quenched dye, which was activated by vesicle destruction giving a clear fluorescent switch on. The interaction of bacterial toxins with the sensor was measured in a proof of principle experiment, then the effect of atmospheric plasma jets with the sensor, was studied in order to assess the cytolytic effect of plasma jets in biological systems. When the plasma contacted the gelatin surface perpendicular to the surface, the treatment resulted in the formation of a star-shaped pattern of microchannels that radiated out from the centre of the treatment area within the gelatin matrix, and locally damaged vesicles within the microchannels at a depth of 150\u00a0\u00b5m below the gelatin surface. Plasma jets applied in parallel to the surface of the matrix resulted in the formation of a single microchannel with damage to the vesicles only evident at the walls of the channel, and a much reduced penetration depth within the gelatin. Our data show that the effects of plasma can be deep in the gelatin material and that the angle of treatment significantly influenced the nature and level of damage to the gelatin and vesicles. Potentially this gelatin model can be used to unravel the roles of different plasma species and the direct effect of whole plasma contact, from those of primary and secondary species\u2014i.e. primary, those emanating directly from the plasma and secondary, those species created in the 'target' tissue. This type of insight could be useful in the future development of safe and effective plasma medical technologies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe continuum theory of elasticity has been used for more than a century and has applications in many fields of science and engineering. It is very robust, well understood and mathematically elegant. In the isotropic case elastic properties are easily represented, but for non-isotropic materials, even in the simple cubic symmetry, it can be difficult to visualise how properties such as Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio vary with stress/strain orientation. The ElAM (Elastic Anisotropy Measures) code carries out the required tensorial operations (inversion, rotation, diagonalisation) and creates 3D models of an elastic property's anisotropy. It can also produce 2D cuts in any given plane, compute averages following diverse schemes and query a database of elastic constants to support meta-analyses.Program summaryProgram title: ElAM1.0Catalogue identifier: AEHB_v1_0Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEHB_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

    "abstract": "Phospholipid vesicles have been the focus of attention as potential vehicles for drug delivery, as they are biomimetic, easy to produce, and contain an aqueous compartment which can be used to carry hydrophilic material, such as drugs or dyes. Lipid vesicles used for this purpose present a particular challenge, as they are not especially stable and can rapidly break down and release their contents away from the target area, especially at physiological temperatures/environments. This study aims to investigate optimum methods for vesicle stabilization where the vesicles are employed as part of a system or technology that signals the presence of pathogenic bacteria via the effect of secreted cytolytic virulence factors on a sensor interface.(1) A number of approaches have been investigated and are presented here as a systematic study of the long-term (14 day) stability at 37 \u00b0C, and at various pHs. The response of vesicles, both in suspension and within hydrogels, to Staphylococcus aureus (RN 4282) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) whole bacteria, and supernatants from overnight cultures of both (containing secreted proteins but free of cells), was measured via a sensitive encapsulated carboxyfluorescein release assay. The results showed that lipid chain length, cholesterol concentration, and stabilization via photopolymer stable components were critical in achieving stability. Finally, dispersion of the optimum vesicle formulation in hydrogel matrixes was investigated, culminating in the in vivo demonstration of a simple prototype wound dressing.",

    "abstract": "The structural and dynamic properties of the mineral Cooperite (PtS) are investigated using density-functional theory. The results show that a competition with the less symmetric but more compact PdS structure leads to a phase transition when the pressure is increased. However, before the phase transition, PtS displays a rare anomalous elastic behavior by expanding along its long axis under hydrostatic pressure. We report the elastic constants of PtS and interpret this negative linear compressibility in the context of a displacive phase transition. We also show that the real structure of PtS is less symmetric than originally determined by experiment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAtomistic simulation methods were used to investigate the surface structures and stability of pyrolusite and ramsdellite polymorphs of electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD). The interactions between the atoms were described using the Born model of Solids. This model was used to calculate the structures and energies of the low index surfaces {0\u00a00\u00a01}, {0\u00a01\u00a00}, {0\u00a01\u00a01}, {1\u00a00\u00a00}, {1\u00a00\u00a01} and {1\u00a01\u00a00} for both pyrolusite and ramsdellite. Pyrolusite is isostructural with rutile and similar to rutile the {1\u00a01\u00a00} surface is found to be the most stable with the relaxed surface energy 2.07\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122. In contrast, for ramsdellite the {1\u00a00\u00a01} surface is the most stable with a surface energy of 1.52\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122. Pyrolusite {1\u00a00\u00a00} and ramsdellite {1\u00a00\u00a00}b surfaces have equivalent energies of 2.43\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122 and 2.45\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122, respectively and similar surface areas and hence are the likely source for the intergrowths. Finally, comparison of the energies of reduction suggests that the more stable surfaces of pyrolusite are more easily reduced.",

It occurs coupled to simultaneous electron transfer at the line junction (or triple phase boundary) formed by the two liquids in contact to an electrode surface. The triple phase boundary can be assembled from a redox active microdroplet deposit of a water-immiscible liquid on a suitable electrode surface immersed into aqueous electrolyte. Ion transfer voltammetry measurements at this type of electrode allow both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for coupled ion and electron transfer processes to be obtained. This overview summarises some recent advances in understanding and application of triple phase boundary redox processes at organic liquid|aqueous electrolyte|working electrode junctions. The design of novel types of electrodes is considered based on (i) extended triple phase boundaries, (ii) porous membrane processes, (iii) hydrodynamic effects, and (iv) generator\u2013collector triple phase boundary systems. Novel facilitated ion transfer processes and photo-electrochemical processes at triple phase boundary electrodes are proposed. Potential future applications of triple phase boundary redox systems in electrosynthesis, sensing, and light energy harvesting are indicated.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Macrocycle 1 affords a C60 complex as a toluene solvate with overall composition C60(1)2(tol)2, 3, whereas the larger macrocycle, 2, affords complexes with both C60 and C70 fullerenes, also as toluene solvates: C60(2)(tol)2, (4); C70(2)(tol)2, (5); and C70(2)2(tol)2, (6). The higher degree of flexibility of such macrocyles relative to classical calixarenes is noteworthy in forming fullerene complexes, with the smaller ring size of 1 favoring fullerene complexation toward the smaller C60 molecule. The supramolecular assemblies involve host\u2212guest interactions as well as interaction of fullerenes in zigzag chains with interfullerene contacts close to the van der Waals limit.",

Consequently, smart drug-delivery systems are being developed for local bactericidal action. The approach takes the concept of nanogels in drug delivery of small molecules to the next level by enclosing them in a shell. Versatile polysaccharide nanogels were loaded with zinc ions as antibacterial agents in a miniemulsion process, in order to target methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The encapsulation of drugs in nanogels is limited by the crosslinking density of the gel and the size of the drug. The characterization of the nanogels with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed that zinc ions cannot be retained within without an additional \u2018shell\u2019 layer. The nanogels were surrounded by a dextran\u2013polyurethane shell, which can retain substances by reduction of water penetration. A delayed zinc release compared to the nanogels was confirmed by ICP-OES. Bacterial tests revealed an antibacterial effect of the shell enhanced nanogels against S. aureus. The studied nanogel system shows potential in locally addressing bacterial infections. The platform is extremely versatile and can be tailored to application as dextran and Zn(NO3)2 can be replaced by other polysaccharides (e.g. hyaluronic acid) and antibacterial agents, respectively.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

After describing well-established classes such as fluorite- and perovskite-based oxides, new materials and structure-types are presented. These include a variety of molybdate, gallate, apatite silicate/germanate and niobate systems, many of which contain flexible structural networks, and exhibit different defect properties and transport mechanisms to the conventional materials. It is concluded that the rich chemistry of these important systems provides diverse possibilities for developing superior ionic conductors for use as solid electrolytes in fuel cells and related applications.

    "abstract": "AbstractFor many years ab initio electronic structure calculations based upon density functional theory have been one of the main application areas in high performance computing (HPC). Typically, the Kohn\u2013Sham equations are solved by minimisation of the total energy functional, using a plane wave basis set for valence electrons and pseudopotentials to obviate the representation of core states. One of the best known and widely used software for performing this type of calculation is the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, VASP, which currently offers a parallelisation strategy based on the distribution of bands and plane wave coefficients over the machine processors. We report here an improved parallelisation strategy that also distributes the k-point sampling workload over different processors, allowing much better scalability for massively parallel computers. As a result, some difficult problems requiring large k-point sampling become tractable in current computing facilities. We showcase three important applications: dielectric function of epitaxially strained indium oxide, solution energies of tetravalent dopants in metallic VO2, and hydrogen on graphene.",

The transformation was achieved by irradiation with a 150 W mercury lamp for 3 d. Monomer pairs in the starting material, 1a, arrange such that the potentially reactive CC double bonds are related by an inversion centre and separated by 3.632(3) \u00c5. In the structure of the irradiation product, 1b, this distance reduces to 1.617(7) \u00c5, with the formation of the planar cyclobutane ring, while maintaining the monoclinic P21/n symmetry of the reactant lattice during the reaction. Attempts to photodimerize two other compounds, 5-bromouracil 2a and maleic acid 3a, whose monomer molecules, within the crystal, were appropriately orientated and with CC double bond separations of less than 4.2 \u00c5, were also undertaken. However, using the same irradiation conditions as for 1a no observable changes occurred for either 2a or 3a. These observations can be rationalised by the presence of a much more extensive hydrogen bonding network than is present in 1a.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe effect of molecular structure on ensemble structure and dynamics of phospholipid bilayers has been investigated. Bilayers of dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) supported on Au(111) surfaces were prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett and Langmuir-Schaeffer deposition and studied with a combination of electrochemical measurements and in situ Polarisation Modulation Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). DMPS bilayers have relatively large capacitance when compared with those formed from similar molecules and this is attributed to a high solvent content within the bilayer, resulting from the need for solvation of the negatively charged lipid headgroups. Infrared spectra show that the ensemble of molecules is in a gel state, with extended and ordered hydrocarbon chains, similarly to bilayers of dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) molecules, which are of similar shape. The infrared spectra also show that, in contrast to DMPE, the headgroups of DMPS are very strongly hydrated and have higher mobility. This higher mobility allows the re-orientation of the molecules under the influence of an applied electric field: re-orientation both of headgroups and hydrocarbon tail groups is observed. Thus the shape and charge of the molecules in an ensemble have a strong influence on both their structure and dynamics in the presence of an externally applied electric field.",

Also, over the same PCT concentration range, the electrode capacitance showed a steady decrease, offering the prospect of a capacitive sensing mode for the label-free device, possibly removing the need to add a redox species to the sample under test. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using pyrene-modified HOPG as a simple platform for label-free impedance biosensors, here for the important sepsis biomarker PCT.",

In this study electrochemically driven mono-, di-, and tri-carboxylate anion transfer at the 4-(3-phenylpropyl)pyridine|aqueous electrolyte interface is investigated experimentally for a triple phase boundary system at graphite electrodes. The tetraphenylporphyrinato-Mn(III/II) redox system (Mn(III/II)TPP) dissolved in the water-immiscible organic phase (4-(3-phenylpropyl)pyridine) is employed for the quantitative study of the structure\u2013Gibbs transfer energy correlation and the effects of the solution pH on the carboxylate transfer process. For di- and tri-carboxylates the partially protonated anions are always transferred preferentially even at a pH higher than the corresponding pKa. COSMO-RS computer simulations are shown to provide a quantitative rationalisation as well as a powerful tool for predicting Gibbs free energy of transfer data for more complex functionalised carboxylate anions. It is shown that the presence of water in the organic phase has a major effect on the calculated Gibbs free energies.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Irradiation in vacuo, in the absence of reactants, produces weak EPR signals of trapped holes (O\u2212) and trapped electrons (Ti3+). When high photon fluxes are used, the intensities of the trapped electron signals are enhanced dramatically when irradiation is stopped. This process is completely reversible on restoring the irradiation, and is attributed to a trapping of EPR invisible conduction band electrons once irradiation is stopped. The trapped electrons are excited back into the conduction band when irradiation is resumed. In the presence of adsorbed organic compounds, products of valence band hole trapping by the organic molecules are detected. Methyl radicals are formed by attack of valence band holes on adsorbed acetic acid. The valence band holes are also able to cleave carbon\u2013silicon bonds, forming methyl radicals from tetramethylsilane. Benzyltrimethylsilane derivatives form both methyl radicals and benzyl radicals through cleavage of all four carbon\u2013silicon bonds. The relevance of these observations to photocatalysed organic reactions in which carbon\u2013carbon bond formation occurs via radical intermediates is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A microfluidic double channel device is employed to study reactions at flowing liquid\u2013liquid junctions in contact with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) working electrode. The rectangular flow cell is calibrated for both single-phase liquid flow and biphasic liquid\u2013liquid flow for the case of (i) the immiscible N-octyl-2-pyrrolidone (NOP)\u2013aqueous electrolyte system and (ii) the immiscible acetonitrile\u2013aqueous electrolyte system. The influence of flow speed and liquid viscosity on the position of the phase boundary and mass transport-controlled limiting currents are examined. In contrast to the NOP\u2013aqueous electrolyte case, the acetonitrile\u2013aqueous electrolyte system is shown to behave close to ideal without \u2018undercutting\u2019 of the organic phase under the aqueous phase. The limiting current for three-phase boundary reactions is only weakly dependent on flow rate but directly proportional to the concentration and the diffusion coefficient in the organic phase. Acetonitrile as a commonly employed synthetic solvent is shown here to allow effective three-phase boundary processes to occur due to a lower viscosity enabling faster diffusion. N-butylferrocene is shown to be oxidised at the acetonitrile\u2013aqueous electrolyte interface about 12 times faster when compared with the same process at the NOP\u2013aqueous electrolyte interface. Conditions suitable for clean two-phase electrosynthetic processes without intentionally added supporting electrolyte in the organic phase are proposed.

Based on our previous study (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2011, 50, 2783) two mechanisms featuring the nucleophilic attack of a hydride ligand at a fluoroarene substrate were considered: (i) a concerted process with Ru\u2013H/C\u2013F exchange occurring in one step; and (ii) a stepwise pathway in which the rate-determining transition state involves formation of HF and a Ru-\u03c3-fluoroaryl complex. The nature of the metal coordination environment and, in particular, the NHC ligand was found to play an important role in both promoting the HDF reaction and determining the regioselectivity of this process. Thus for the reaction of C6F5H, the full experimental system (NHC = IMes, R = Ph) promotes HDF through (i) more facile initial PR3/fluoroarene substitution and (ii) the ability of the NHC N-aryl substituents to stabilise the key C\u2013F bond breaking transition state through F\u22efHC interactions. This latter effect is maximised along the lower energy stepwise pathway when an ortho-H substituent is present and this accounts for the ortho-selectivity seen in the reaction of C6F5H to give 1,2,3,4-C6F4H2. Computed C\u2013F bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for C6F6\u2212nHn substrates show a general increase with larger n and are most sensitive to the number of ortho-F substituents present. However, HDF is always computed to remain significantly exothermic when a silane such as Me3SiH is included as terminal reductant. Computed barriers to HDF also generally increase with greater n, and for the concerted pathway a good correlation between C\u2013F BDE and barrier height is seen. The two mechanisms were found to have complementary regioselectivities. For the concerted pathway the reaction is directed to sites with two ortho-F substituents, as these have the weakest C\u2013F bonds. In contrast, reaction along the stepwise pathway is directed to sites with only one ortho-F substituent, due to difficulties in accommodating ortho-F substituents in the C\u2013F bond cleavage transition state. Calculations predict that 1,2,3,5-C6F4H2 and 1,2,3,4-C6F4H2 are viable candidates for HDF at [Ru(IMes)(PPh3)2(CO)(H)2] and that this would proceed selectively to give 1,2,4-C6F3H3 and 1,2,3-C6F3H3, respectively.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The crystallinity of the Bi2S3 is found to be dependent on the annealing temperature, as determined by X-ray diffraction. The porous Bi2S3 films are infiltrated with the hole conductor P3HT to generate novel hybrid films, and laser-based transient absorption spectroscopy is used to interrogate the charge-separation reaction at the resulting Bi2S3/P3HT heterojunction. Specifically, optical excitation of the hybrid films results in efficient and long-lived charge separation (microsecond to millisecond timescale), thereby rendering such films suitable for the development of novel low-cost solar-energy conversion devices.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the development and application of a multi-residue chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry method for simultaneous enantiomeric profiling of 18 chiral pharmaceuticals and their active metabolites (belonging to several therapeutic classes including analgesics, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs and \u03b2-agonists) in surface water and wastewater. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first time an enantiomeric method including such a high number of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites has been reported. Some of the pharmaceuticals have never been studied before in environmental matrices. Among them are timolol, betaxolol, carazolol and clenbuterol. A monitoring programme of the Guadalquivir River basin (South Spain), including 24 sampling sites and five wastewater treatment plants along the basin, revealed that enantiomeric composition of studied pharmaceuticals is dependent on compound and sampling site. Several compounds such as ibuprofen, atenolol, sotalol and metoprolol were frequently found as racemic mixtures. On the other hand, fluoxetine, propranolol and albuterol were found to be enriched with one enantiomer. Such an outcome might be of significant environmental relevance as two enantiomers of the same chiral compound might reveal different ecotoxicity. For example, propranolol was enriched with S(\u2212)-enantiomer, which is known to be more toxic to Pimephales promelas than R(+)-propranolol. Fluoxetine was found to be enriched with S(+)-enantiomer, which is more toxic to P. promelas than R(\u2212)-fluoxetine.",

Loss of a proton introduces an alkene, which reacts with a further acylium ion. A concerted 1,2-hydride shift/oxonium formation, followed by elimination, leads to formation of the observed product.",

    "abstract": " A series of butadiyne-linked zinc porphyrin oligomers, with one, two, three, and four porphyrin units and lengths of up to 75 \u00c5, have been spin-labeled at both ends with stable nitroxide TEMPO radicals. The pulsed EPR technique of double electron electron resonance (DEER) was used to probe the distribution of intramolecular end-to-end distances, under a range of conditions. DEER measurements were carried out at 50 K in two types of dilute solution glasses: deutero-toluene (with 10% deutero-pyridine) and deutero-o-terphenyl (with 5% 4-benzyl pyridine). The complexes of the porphyrin oligomers with monodentate ligands (pyridine or 4-benzyl pyridine) principally adopt linear conformations. Nonlinear conformations are less populated in the lower glass-transition temperature solvent. When the oligomers bind star-shaped multidentate ligands, they are forced to bend into nonlinear geometries, and the experimental end-to-end distances for these complexes match those from molecular mechanics calculations. Our results show that porphyrin-based molecular wires are shape-persistent, and yet that their shapes can deformed by binding to multivalent ligands. Self-assembled ladder-shaped 2:2 complexes were also investigated to illustrate the scope of DEER measurements for providing structural information on synthetic noncovalent nanostructures.",

A series of quinoline-8-carboxamides was designed to maintain the required pharmacophore conformation through an intramolecular hydrogen bond. 3-Substituted quinoline-8-carboxamides were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed couplings (Suzuki, Sonogashira, Stille) to 3-iodoquinoline-8-carboxamide, an efficient process that introduces diversity in the final step. 2-Substituted quinoline-8-carboxamides were prepared by selective Pd-catalyzed couplings at the 2-position of 2,8-dibromoquinoline, followed by lithium\u2212bromine exchange of the intermediate 2-(alkyl/aryl)-8-bromoquinolines and reaction with trimethylsilyl isocyanate. The intramolecular hydrogen bond was confirmed by X-ray and by NMR. The SAR of the 3-substituted compounds for inhibition of human recombinant PARP-1 activity showed a requirement for a small narrow group. Substituents in the 2-position increased potency, with the most active 2-methylquinoline-8-carboxamide having IC50 = 500 nM (IC50 = 1.8 \u03bcM for 5-aminoisoquinolin-1-one (5-AIQ, a standard water-soluble inhibitor)).",

    "abstract": "We have calculated x-ray photoemission (XPS) spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts for amorphous alumina from first principles. We generate models for amorphous structures at three different densities by means of a stochastic quenching procedure. We analyze these structures by calculating radial distribution functions, angle distributions functions, bond lengths, and coordination numbers. Our amorphous models compare well with previous molecular dynamics simulations and experiments. We include in our study, the stable phase of alumina $\\ensuremath{\\alpha}$, some of the transition phases, that is, $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$, $\\ensuremath{\\gamma}$, and $\\ensuremath{\\kappa}$, and the hypothetical bixbyite structure for comparison. Our results reproduce both XPS spectra and NMR chemical shifts and suggest that the XPS failure to resolve the different local environments in the different phases of alumina is due to the strong ionicity of the Al-O bond. Our calculated NMR chemical shifts show that the local environments are well resolved. We estimate the broadening of the NMR peaks due to local atomic environment differences in the amorphous phase to be as large as 35 ppm.",

They are normally produced as moderately dense silicates (SiO2) and aluminosilicates making their specific capacities for the uptake and storage of gases, such as hydrogen, relatively low. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of lightweight, nanoporous structures formed from the metal hydroxide Be(OH)2 in combination with relatively low levels of framework phosphate or arsenate. Three new zeotype structures are described, constructed mainly of Be(OH)4 tetrahedra bridged through hydroxide into three-membered rings; these units link together to produce several previously unknown zeotype cage types and some of the most structurally complex, nanoporous materials ever discovered. These materials have very low densities between 1.12 and 1.37\u2009g\u2009cm\u22123 and theoretical porosities of 63\u201368% of their total volume thereby yielding very high total specific pore volumes of up to 0.60\u2009cm3\u2009g\u22121.",

    "abstract": "Both homo- and heteroleptic alkyl and amide complexes of the Group\u20052 elements Mg and Ca are shown to be active for the catalytic dehydrocoupling of Me2NH\u22c5BH3. Reactions of either magnesium dialkyls or the \u03b2-diketiminate complex [HC{(Me)CN(Dipp)}2MgnBu] with four or two equivalents of Me2NHBH3, respectively, produce compounds containing the [H3BNMe2BH2Me2N]\u2212 ion, which coordinates to the magnesium centers through MgN and Mg\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5HB interactions in both the solution and solid states. Thermolysis of these compounds at 60\u2009\u00b0C produces the cyclic product [(H2BNMe2)2] and, it is proposed, magnesium hydrido species by an unprecedented \u03b4-hydride elimination process. Calcium-based species, although less reactive than their magnesium-based counterparts, are found to engage in similar dehydrocoupling reactivity and to produce a similar distribution of products under thermally promoted catalytic conditions. A mechanism for these observations is presented that involves initial production and insertion of H2BNMe2 into polarized MN bonds as the major BN bond-forming step. The efficacy of this insertion and subsequent \u03b2- or \u03b4-hydride elimination steps is proposed to be dependent upon the charge density and polarizing capability of the participating Group\u20052 center, providing a rationale for the observed differences in reactivity between magnesium and calcium.",

We will give a concise summary of important results from our past work and lay important connections with the different parts. This overview shows the versatility and great potential cellulose nanoparticles have in electrochemical applications while employing straightforward techniques for device assembly and fabrication. Extension of this work towards free-standing functional membranes is also discussed where appropriate. ",

    "abstract": "The enzymatic activity of Hl-lipase embedded in complexes of poly-2-methylvinylpyridinium-co-poly(ethylene oxide) (P2MVP41\u2212PEO205) and poly(acrylic acid)(PAA139) is studied as a function of the PAA139 + P2MVP41\u2212PEO205 complex composition. The measurements revealed that there are several factors that influence the enzymatic activity. When incorporated in micelles, the activity of lipase is increased, which suggests that the micelles favor the active state. The activity may further increase because the substrate tends to accumulate to the micelles. It is found that the presence of PAA139 alone also increases the enzymatic activity somewhat. Increasing of the ionic strength decreases the enzymatic activity in all systems. However, at ionic strengths where the micelles are disintegrated (>0.5 M), the activity of lipase in the presence of both polyelectrolytes is still higher than the activity of free lipase. At 0.7 M NaCl it was found that lipase in the presence of (just) P2MVP41\u2212PEO205 is more active than lipase without this additive.",

The synthesized PMO film has a face-centered orthorhombic porous structure with a 15 nm pore diameter. This large pore size enables the inclusion of electron-conducting species such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester in the periodic mesopores.

At pH\u20057.5 a switch in mechanism occurs from phosphate transfer to hydroxide transfer. Accelerated charge transport is observed lateral to the oil|water interface. Improved boronic acid facilitators and nanotrench electrodes are discussed in terms of future feasibility for phosphate sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Topological insulators represent a paradigm shift in surface physics. The most extensively studied ${\\mathrm{Bi}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Se}}_{3}$-type topological insulators exhibit layered structures, wherein neighboring layers are weakly bonded by van der Waals interactions. Using first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we investigate the impact of the stacking sequence on the energetics and band structure properties of three polymorphs of ${\\mathrm{Bi}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Se}}_{3},{\\mathrm{Bi}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Te}}_{3}$, and ${\\mathrm{Sb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Te}}_{3}$. Considering their ultrathin films up to 6 nm as a function of its layer thickness, the overall dispersion of the band structure is found to be insensitive to the stacking sequence, while the band gap is highly sensitive, which may also affect the critical thickness for the onset of the topologically nontrivial phase. Our calculations are consistent with both experimental and theoretical results, where available. We further investigate tribological layer slippage, where we find a relatively low energy barrier between two of the considered structures. Both the stacking-dependent band gap and low slippage energy barriers suggest that polymorphic stacking modification may offer an alternative route for controlling the properties of this new state of matter.",

In the short period that has elapsed since, there has been an ever-increasing level of interest in molecules of this type, as evidenced by the volume of publications in this area. This interest has been driven by the highly unusual properties of these molecules in comparison to their linear oligoarene analogues, as well as the diverse array of potential applications for them. Notably, CPPs and related structures were proposed as viable templates for the bottom-up synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), a proposition which has recently been realised. This review gives a comprehensive and strictly chronological (by date of first online publication) treatment of literature reports from the inception of the field, with emphasis on both synthesis and properties of CPPs and related nanohoops. (The scope of this review is restricted to molecules possessing a radial \u03c0 system consisting entirely of subunits which are aromatic in isolation, e.g. CPPs, but not cycloparaphenyleneacetylenes or cyclopolyacetylenes).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Elsewhere, a significant disclosure from Que is the first system able to catalyse the dearomatising dihydroxylation of an arene and Katsuki has reported the use of a dimeric Fe \u201csalan\u201d (reduced salen) complex to catalyse oxidative dimerisation of naphthols, affording BINOLs that are themselves ligands for asymmetric synthesis. In the field of reduction, the development of novel chiral phosphine ligands remains a prominent subject of research for alkene hydrogenation. There is sustained interest in oxazaborolidines as catalysts for ketone reduction and several methods for direct asymmetric reductive alkylation are reported. A general trend seen is increased activity in the area of green chemistry and there have been many reports on the use of nanoparticles as catalysts.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The complexity of the nitrobenzene reduction in conjunction with the presence of ambient levels of oxygen in the analysis solution provide a challenging problem in which feedback-amplified generator\u2013collector steady state currents provide the analytical signal. In contrast to the more openly accessible geometry of the interdigitated array electrode, where the voltammetric response for nitrobenzene is less well-defined and signals drift, the voltammetric response for the cavity-like microtrench electrode is stable and readily detectable at 1 \u03bcM level. Both types of electrode show oxygen-enhanced low concentration collector current responses due to additional feedback via reaction intermediates. The observations are rationalised in terms of a \u201ccavity transport coefficient\u201d which is beneficial in the dual-plate microtrench, where oxygen interference effects are suppressed and the analytical signal is amplified and stabilised.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

In this paper, we introduce a general method for the fabrication of metal sulfide nanoparticle/polymer films employing a low-cost and low temperature route compatible with large-scale device manufacturing. Our approach is based upon the controlled in situ thermal decomposition of a solution processable metal xanthate precursor complex in a semiconducting polymer film. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we fabricate a CdS/P3HT nanocomposite film and show that the metal sulfide network inside the polymer film assists in the absorption of visible light and enables the achievement of high yields of charge photogeneration at the CdS/P3HT heterojunction. Photovoltaic devices based upon such nanocomposite films show solar light to electrical energy conversion efficiencies of 0.7% under full AM1.5 illumination and 1.2% under 10% incident power, demonstrating the potential of such nanocomposite films for low-cost photovoltaic devices.Keywords:  Organic solar cells; hybrid optoelectronics; inorganic nanoparticles; polymer semiconductors; electron transfer; quantum dots, metal xanthate",

    "abstract": "Atomic pair distribution functions are useful because they have an easy intuitive interpretation and can be obtained both experimentally and from computer-generated structure models. For bulk materials, atomic pair distribution functions are solely determined by the intrinsic atomic geometry, i.e., how atoms are positioned with respect to one another. For a nanomaterial, however, the atomic pair distribution function also depends on the shape and size of the nanomaterial. A modified form of the radial distribution function is discussed that decouples shape and size effects from intrinsic effects so that nanomaterials of any shape and size, sharing a common atomic geometry, map onto a universal curve, by using a form factor. Mapping onto this universal curve allows differences in the intrinsic atomic geometry of nanomaterials of various shapes and sizes to be directly compared. This approach is demonstrated on nanoscale amorphous and crystalline silica models. It is shown how form factors can be computed for arbitrary shapes and this is illustrated for tetrahedral nanoparticles of vitreous silica.",

Good agreement between the optical constants derived from QSGW and those obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry enables the assignment of the spectral features to their respective inter-band transitions. We show that the transition from the highest valence band (VB) to the lowest conduction band (CB) is responsible for almost all the optical response of MAPbI3 between 1.2 and 5.5 eV (with minor contributions from the second highest VB and the second lowest CB). The calculations indicate that the orientation of [CH3NH3]+ cations has a significant influence on the position of the bandgap suggesting that collective orientation of the organic moieties could result in significant local variations of the optical properties. The optical constants and energy band diagram of CH3NH3PbI3 are then used to simulate the contributions from different optical transitions to a typical transient absorption spectrum (TAS).\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractPLGA microspheres loaded with cisplatin were produced using a single emulsion method. A semi-empirical model, with bi-exponential terms, was found to give a better fit to the drug release profiles compared to a mono-exponential model. This model suggests that there are two separate fractions of drug present in the depot. A fraction of the drug is located near/at the surface of the depot, and is readily released during immersion in buffer. A second fraction of drug is entrapped deeper within the depot and is subsequently released. It was also found that the initial release of cisplatin from PLGA microsphere is highly diffusion-controlled and the classical Higuchi model provides a good fit. From studies of water diffusion using PFG-NMR, results suggested that 50:50 PLGA microsphere was most susceptible to swelling and this might have promoted the faster initial drug release. Results from NMR cryoporometry also indicated that the developed PLGA microspheres could have \u201cink-bottle\u201d pores.",

    "abstract": "Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite can make high-efficiency solar cells, which also show an unexplained photocurrent hysteresis dependent on the device-poling history. Here we report quasielastic neutron scattering measurements showing that dipolar CH3NH3+ ions reorientate between the faces, corners or edges of the pseudo-cubic lattice cages in CH3NH3PbI3 crystals with a room temperature residence time of ~14\u2009ps. Free rotation, \u03c0-flips and ionic diffusion are ruled out within a 1\u2013200-ps time window. Monte Carlo simulations of interacting CH3NH3+ dipoles realigning within a 3D lattice suggest that the scattering measurements may be explained by the stabilization of CH3NH3+ in either antiferroelectric or ferroelectric domains. Collective realignment of CH3NH3+ to screen a device\u2019s built-in potential could reduce photovoltaic performance. However, we estimate the timescale for a domain wall to traverse a typical device to be ~0.1\u20131\u2009ms, faster than most observed hysteresis.",

    "abstract": "A SAR translation strategy adopted for the discovery of tetrahydroisoquinolinone (THIQ)-based steroidomimetic microtubule disruptors has been extended to dihydroisoquinolinone (DHIQ)-based compounds. A steroid A,B-ring-mimicking DHIQ core was connected to methoxyaryl D-ring mimics through methylene, carbonyl, and sulfonyl linkers, and the resulting compounds were evaluated against two cancer cell lines. The carbonyl-linked DHIQs in particular exhibit significant in vitro antiproliferative activities (e.g., 6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one (16\u2009g): GI50 51\u2005nM in DU-145 cells). The broad anticancer activity of DHIQ 16\u2009g was confirmed in the NCI 60-cell line assay giving a mean activity of 33\u2005nM. Furthermore, 6-hydroxy-2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl)-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one (16\u2009f) and 16\u2009g and their sulfamate derivatives 17\u2009f and 17\u2009g (2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl)-7-methoxy-6-sulfamoyloxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one and 7-methoxy-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-6-sulfamoyloxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one, respectively) show excellent activity against the polymerization of tubulin, close to that of the clinical combretastatin A-4, and bind competitively at the colchicine binding site of tubulin. Compounds 16\u2009f and 17\u2009f were also shown to demonstrate in vitro anti-angiogenic activity. Additionally, X-ray and computational analyses of 17\u2009f reveal that electrostatic repulsion between the two adjacent carbonyl groups, through conformational biasing, dictates the adoption of a \u201csteroid-like\u201d conformation that may partially explain the excellent in vitro activities.",

The X-ray crystal structures of 1a\u2212c show that all three P\u2212O\u2212P ligands coordinate in a tridentate manner through phosphorus and oxygen. Abstraction of the chloride ligand from 1a\u2212c by NaBAr4F (BAr4F = B(3,5-C6H3(CF3)2)4) gives the cationic aqua complexes [Ru(P\u2212O\u2212P)(PPh3)(H2O)H]BAr4F (3a\u2212c). Removal of chloride from 1a by AgOTf yields Ru(xantphos)(PPh3)H(OTf) (2a), which reacts with water to form [Ru(xantphos)(PPh3)(H2O)H](OTf). The aqua complexes 3a\u2212b react with O2 to generate [Ru(xantphos)(PPh3)(\u03b72-O2)H]BAr4F (5a) and [Ru(DPEphos)(PPh3)(\u03b72-O2)H]BAr4F (5b). Addition of H2 or N2 to 3a\u2212c yields the thermally unstable dihydrogen and dinitrogen species [Ru(P\u2212O\u2212P)(PPh3)(\u03b72-H2)H]BAr4F (6a\u2212c) and [Ru(P\u2212O\u2212P)(PPh3)(N2)H]BAr4F (7a\u2212c), which have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy at low temperature. Ru(PPh3)3HCl reacts with 1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) to give the 16-electron complex Ru(dppf)(PPh3)HCl (1d), which upon treatment with NaBAr4F, affords [Ru(dppf){(\u03b76-C6H5)PPh2}H]BAr4F (8), in which the PPh3 ligand binds \u03b76 through one of the PPh3 phenyl rings.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe aim of this investigation was to determine if cavitation occurred around dental ultrasonic scalers and to estimate the amount of cavitation occurring. Three styles of tip (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0TFI-10, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0TFI-3, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0TFI-1) were used, in conjunction with a Cavitron SPS ultrasonic generator (Dentsply, USA), to insonate terephthalic acid solution. The hydroxyl radical, [OH], concentration, produced due to cavitation from the scaler tips, was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Cavitational activity was enhanced at higher power settings and at longer operating times. The tip dimensions and geometry as well as the generator power setting are both important factors that affect the production of cavitation.",

The resulting boronic acid modified nanoparticles are water-insoluble and readily deposited onto graphite electrodes, for example for electroanalytical applications. Boronic acid binding to the ortho-quinol caffeic acid is demonstrated and the mechanism based on ligand fluxionality is further investigated. Electrodes based on nanoparticle aggregates are sensitive to caffeic acid with Langmuirian binding constants estimated as 106 mol\u22121 dm3. The molecular structure of the pyrene-appended boronic acid affects the ability to bind caffeic acid as well as, more importantly, the fluxional transformation of the strongly bound (high oxidation potential) into the weakly bound (low oxidation potential) form. The resulting design principles for improved boronic acid receptors are discussed.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The cP4VP dots retain their intrinsic fluorescence in a cellular environment and exhibit an average excited-state lifetime of 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 ns in the cell. The cP4VP dots enter HeLa cells and do not cause significant damage to outer cell membranes.

The carbon nanoparticles provide a highly hydrophobic substrate with ca. 25\u2005Fg\u22121 capacitance when bare. Q10 or DMPC-Q10 immobilised onto the carbon nanoparticles lower the capacitance, but give rise to well-defined pH-dependent voltammetric responses. The DMPC-Q10 deposit shows similar characteristics to those of Q10, but with better reproducibility and higher sensitivity. Both redox systems, Q10 and DMPC-Q10, are sensitive to the Na+ concentration in the electrolyte and mechanistic implications are discussed.",

In detail, ten different gold mass loads on zinc oxide were exposed to 1,064\u00a0nm cw-laser radiation. Variation of scan speed, laser power, and spot size showed that the energy threshold required for sintering decreases and sintering process window widens compared to laser sintering of pure zinc oxide powder. Transmission electron microscope analysis after focused ion beam cross sectioning of the sintered particles reveals that supported gold nanoparticles homogenously resolidify in the sintered semiconductor matrix.

The crystal structures of the isotypic sialons were determined by single-crystal X-ray investigations (Sr3Ce10Si18Al12O18N36: I3m, Z = 2, a = 1338.2(2)\u00a0pm, R1 = 0.0333; Sr3Pr10Si18Al12O18N36: a = 1334.54(6)\u00a0pm, R1 = 0.0296; Sr3Nd10Si18Al12O18N36: a = 1332.85(6)\u00a0pm, R1 = 0.0271) and in the case of Sr3Pr10Si18Al12O18N36 with powder neutron diffraction as well.

Besides the bridging O and N atoms of the sialon network there are isolated O2\u2212 which are tetrahedrally coordinated by Sr and Ln. The crystallographic differentiation of Si/Al and O/N seemed to be possible by a careful evaluation of the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data combined with lattice energy calculations using the MAPLE concept (Madelung Part of Lattice Energy).

One type of catalyst used palladium complexes containing phosphine and/or acetate ligands for applications in Suzuki and Heck reactions. The second type consisted of Pd(0)-functionalised magnetic cores for use in hydrogenation and C\u2013C coupling. Each type was effective for a range of reactions and was easily recoverable from the reaction mixture due to the superparamagnetic behaviour of the support. Detailed rate studies, found to correspond to pseudo-first-order kinetics, were conducted to assist in determining the mechanism of the reactions and showed that, during Heck reactions, Pd leaching is critically dependent on the presence of the aryl halide. The catalysts were found to retain their activity for several cycles although the rate of reaction was markedly reduced on re-use.",

Experiments were performed at high and low temperatures to separate the contributions of chemisorption and physisorption, low-temperature data being potentially important for the ambient temperature purification processes. Analysis of thermokinetic data obtained from heat output curves at an elevated temperature allows one to distinguish the transition between reaction of ammonia with the acid sites and the onset of physical sorption. Thermokinetic data are also sensitive to the pore structure of the support materials, with faster sorption registered in the case of materials with the open mesoporous structure. The SBA-15 supported acid shows the maximum ammonia uptake and the strongest acid sites among the three materials studied. The dynamics of sorption, characterized by the thermokinetic parameter, appears to be better in the two materials possessing open pore structure, mesoporous carbon Novacarb and especially the mesoporous silica SBA-15.

Although the behavior of o-(N,N-dialkylaminomethyl) free acid and ester proved to be complicated, we were able to extract some important trends from our calculations: (1) for the free acids the intramolecular hydrogen-bonded B\u2212O\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N seven-membered ring conformers 12 and 16 are found to be slightly lower in energy than the dative-bonded N\u2192B five-membered ring conformers 10 and 14 while conformers 13 and 17, with no direct boron\u2212nitrogen interaction, are significantly higher in energy than 12 and 16; (2) for the esters where no intramolecular B\u2212O\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N bonded form is possible, the N\u2192B conformers 18 and 21 are significantly lower in energy than the no-interaction forms 20 and 23; (3) H2O insertion reactions into the N\u2192B structures 10, 14, 18, and 21 leading to the seven-membered intermolecular hydrogen-bonded B\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OH2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N ring structures 11, 15, 19, and 22 are all energetically favorable.",

Solid state structures of 1\u20134 resemble closely those of their triaryl-substituted analogues. The condensation reaction to 4 was looked at by detailed NMR investigations and revealed that amine/aniline exchange is occurring in solutions containing free aniline even at ambient conditions setting up an equilibrium between all possible symmetrical and unsymmetrical triazacylcohexanes. Selective crystallisation of 4 from the solution drives the reaction to high yields of 4. Complexes 1\u20134 react readily with CrCl3 or CrCl3(THF)3 to form the corresponding CrCl3 complexes.

In this report we demonstrate, by in vitro kinetic studies of d-2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) kinase and KDG aldolase, that the part-phosphorylative pathway in S. solfataricus is also promiscuous for the metabolism of both glucose and galactose.",

For DL-scyllo-inositol 1,2,4-trisphosphate, DL-1-O-allyl 1\u20133,6-di-O-benzyl-4,5-O-isopropylidene-scyllo-inositol was prepared from the triflate of DL-1-O-allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-4\u20135-O-isopropylidene-myo-inositol by inversion at C-2. Removal of the isopropylidene group and phosphorylation gave the protected trisphosphate. Deblocking with sodium in liquid ammonia afforded racemic scyllo-inositol 1,2,4-trisphosphate. DL-1-O-Allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-4,5-O-isopropylidene-scyllo-inositol was resolved into its enantiomers by means of the crystalline 2-O-camphanate ester. The structure of one diastereoisomer, 1D-O-allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-2-O-[(\u2013)-camphanate]-4,5\u20130-isopropylidene-scyllo-inositol was determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. 1D-(+)-1-O-Allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-4,5-O-isopropylidene-scyllo-inositol was used to prepare 1L(\u2013)-scyllo-inositol 1,2,4-trisphosphate in a fashion analogous to the racemic modification. DL-1-O-Allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-scyllo-inositol was isomerised to the (Z)-prop-1-enyl derivative. The propenyl group was then removed to give the meso-1,4-di-O-benzyscyllo-inositol. Phosphitylation followed by oxidation or sulfoxidation gave the fully protected tetrakis-phosphate or -phosphorothioate, respectively. After deblocking and purification, scyllo-inositol 1,2,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and scyllo inositol 1,2,4,5-tetrakisphosphorothioate were obtained.\r  DL-1-O-Allyl-3,6-di-O-benzyl-4,5-O-isopropylidene-scyllo-inositol was isomerised to the 1-O-[(Z)-prop-1-enyl] derivative which was converted into the 2-O-triflate. Displacement of the triflate using tetrabutylammonium fluoride proceeded with inversion of configuration to give DL-3,6-di-O-beflzyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-4,5-O-isopropylidene-1-O-([(Z)-prop-1-eny]-myo-inositol. Removal of propenyl and isopropylidene groups afforded DL-3,6-di-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-myo-inositol, which was phosphitylated and the product oxidised to give the fully protected 2-fluoro trisphosphate. Deprotection furnished DL-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

Operating at 110\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, it was shown that high conversions (>99%) into the desired tertiary amine could be achieved. This reaction was then shown to be viable in a continuous flow reactor, where the catalytic polymer beads were retained in the bed. Operating at 150\u00a0\u00b0C and using p-xylene as a solvent, the conversion into the desired tertiary amine was shown to be as high as 98%. This approach is clearly very promising, as it provides a greener and more atom efficient route for the production of secondary and tertiary amines in the pharmaceutical industry.",

    "abstract": "Rhamnolipids (RLs) are heterogeneous glycolipid molecules that are composed of one or two l-rhamnose sugars and one or two \u03b2-hydroxy fatty acids, which can vary in their length and branch size. They are biosurfactants, predominantly produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are important virulence factors, playing a major role in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis. Therefore, a fast, accurate and high-throughput method of detecting such molecules is of real importance. Here, we illustrate the ability to detect RL-producing P. aeruginosa strains with high sensitivity, based on an assay involving phospholipid vesicles encapsulated with a fluorescent dye. This vesicle-lysis assay is confirmed to be solely sensitive to RLs. We illustrate a half maximum concentration for vesicle lysis (EC50) of 40\u00a0\u03bcM (23.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) using pure commercial RLs and highlight the ability to semi-quantify RLs directly from the culture supernatant, requiring no extra extraction or processing steps or technical expertise. We show that this method is consistent with results from thin-layer chromatography detection and dry weight analysis of RLs but find that the widely used orcinol colorimetric test significantly underestimated RL quantity. Finally, we apply this methodology to compare RL production among strains isolated from either chronic or acute infections. We confirm a positive association between RL production and acute infection isolates (p\u2009=\u20090.0008), highlighting the role of RLs in certain infections.",

    "abstract": "AbstractChiral sulfoximines have applications as transition-state mimicking enzyme inhibitors, as peptide isosteres and as chiral auxiliaries in synthesis. To access the required O-protected 4-(arylsulfonimidoyl)butane-1,2,3-triols, 4S,5S-di(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane (prepared from diethyl R,R-tartrate) was converted into its monobenzyl ether. Mitsunobu-like coupling with thiophenols gave 4S,5R-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-(arylthiomethyl)-1,3-dioxolanes. Sulfoxidation and S-imination (trifluoroacetamide, iodosobenzene diacetate, rhodium acetate) proceeded without stereoselectivity, giving inseparable diastereomeric mixtures of 4S,5R,S(\u00b1)-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-(N-(trifluoroacetyl)arylsulfonimidoylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolanes. Removal of the trifluoroacetyl protection allowed chromatographic separation of the diastereomeric 4S,5R,S(\u00b1)-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-5-(arylsulfonimidoylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolanes. The configurations at sulfur were determined by X-ray crystallography and some analysis of the solution and solid-state conformations was carried out. The resulting O-protected 4-(arylsulfonimidoyl)butane-1,2,3-triols are of use in developing enzyme inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe step-wise ion exchange replacement of sodium by either potassium or strontium has been studied for the two highly aluminous zeolites MAX (maximum aluminium X or LSX, low-silica X) and MAP (maximum aluminium P) to determine ion exchange selectivities. Powder diffraction data were gathered at different degrees of exchange and used to refine the structures of hydrated MAX exchanged with strontium (powder X-ray diffraction) or potassium (powder neutron diffraction). The cubic lattice of MAX expanded (from 25.06\u00a0\u00c5 to 25.15\u00a0\u00c5) when 80% metal loading (K+ or Sr2+) was achieved. Concurrent measurements of ion exchange selectivity showed a sharp decrease in selectivity coefficients at 80% metal loading. These results and evaluation of earlier work indicates that structural changes (e.g. lattice expansion) may be a major cause for the strong non-ideality of ion exchange selectivity, commonly observed in high aluminium zeolites ion exchange. Changes in solution pH may also be an important factor affecting the ion exchange selectivities because the dissociation of OH-groups the weakly acidic zeolites is sensitive to solution pH.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe ubiquitous bacterial pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, expresses a large arsenal of virulence factors essential for pathogenesis. The phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are a family of cytolytic peptide toxins which have multiple roles in staphylococcal virulence. To gain an insight into which specific factors are important in PSM-mediated cell membrane disruption, the lytic activity of individual PSM peptides against phospholipid vesicles and T cells was investigated. Vesicles were most susceptible to lysis by the PSM\u00ce\u00b1 subclass of peptides (\u00ce\u00b11\u20133 in particular), when containing between 10 and 30\u00a0mol% cholesterol, which for these vesicles is the mixed solid ordered (so)\u2013liquid ordered (lo) phase. Our results show that the PSM\u00ce\u00b2 class of peptides has little effect on vesicles at concentrations comparable to that of the PSM\u00ce\u00b1 class and exhibited no cytotoxicity. Furthermore, within the PSM\u00ce\u00b1 class, differences emerged with PSM\u00ce\u00b14 showing decreased vesicle and cytotoxic activity in comparison to its counterparts, in contrast to previous studies. In order to understand this, peptides were studied using helical wheel projections and circular dichroism measurements. The degree of amphipathicity, alpha-helicity and properties such as charge and hydrophobicity were calculated, allowing a structure\u2013function relationship to be inferred. The degree of alpha-helicity of the peptides was the single most important property of the seven peptides studied in predicting their lytic activity. These results help to redefine this class of peptide toxins and also highlight certain membrane parameters required for efficient lysis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study highlights the effects of the electrochemical surface pre-treatment of polished polycrystalline boron-doped diamond electrodes in ethanol on electron transfer to organic redox systems. A novel \u201cactivation\u201d procedure based on cathodic polarisation in ethanol (0.01\u00a0M NBu4PF6) is proposed and shown to be highly effective in promoting electron transfer to the aqueous Fe(CN)63-/4- redox system. For redox systems in acetonitrile, effects on electron transfer processes are strongly dependent on the type of electron transfer process. For decamethylferrocene+/0, decamethylcobaltocene+/0, methyviologen2+/+, and for methylviologen+/0 redox systems essentially reversible electron transfer is observed irrespective of the pre-treatment of the boron-doped diamond electrode. For the benzoquinone0/\u2212 redox system insignificant changes occur but for the benzoquinone\u2212/2\u2212 process a more dramatic change in electron transfer kinetics is observed (after cathodic polarisation in ethanol) consistent with an improved interfacial electron transfer (a 4.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0increase in peak current occurs). Finally, the tetraethyl-ethylenetetracarboxylate0/\u2212 system is investigated as a model olefin redox system. Again changes in reactivity occur (a 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0increase in peak current) at the cathodically pre-treated boron-doped diamond electrode. XPS surface analysis data reveal only insignificant changes in the chemical composition of the boron-doped diamond surface before and after activation and therefore a predominantly electronic mechanism for the \u201cactivation\u201d process is proposed. In future selectivity effects for electron transfer at boron-doped diamond electrode surfaces could be introduced intentionally and used beneficially for chemo-selective electro-organic processes.",

    "abstract": "A new family of silicate materials has attracted interest for potential use in rechargeable lithium batteries. The defect chemistry, doping behavior, and lithium diffusion paths in the Li2MnSiO4 cathode material are investigated by advanced modeling techniques. Our simulations show good reproduction of both monoclinic and orthorhombic structures of Li2MnSiO4. The most favorable intrinsic defect type is found to be the cation anti-site defect, in which Li and Mn ions exchange positions. The migration energies suggest differences in intrinsic Li mobility between the monoclinic and orthorhombic polymorphs, which would affect their rate capability as rechargeable electrodes. The results indicate curved Li diffusion paths and confirm the anisotropic nature of Li transport, which is probably general for the Li2MSiO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co) family of compounds. Subvalent doping by Al on the Si site is energetically favorable and could be a synthesis strategy to increase the Li content.",

Crystal structures of [Fe(H2Bpz2)2(dpq)], [Fe(H2Bpz2)2(dppz)], and [Fe(H2Bpz2)2(dppn)] all reveal stacks of complex molecules formed through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking between interdigitated bipyridyl chelate ligands, often with additional intercalated toluene or uncoordinated bipyridyl ligand (dpq). Molecules of [Fe(H2Bpz2)2(dppc)] form a different stacking motif in the crystal, with weaker contacts between individual molecules. Many of the structures also contain channels of disordered solvent, running between the molecular stacks. Despite their different stacking motifs, all these compounds exhibit very gradual thermal spin-crossover (SCO) on cooling, which occur over different temperature ranges but are otherwise quite similar in form. Weak thermal hysteresis in one of these spin equilibria can be attributed to the effects of a change in bipyridyl ligand conformation in the molecular stacks around 150 K, which was observed crystallographically. These results demonstrate that strong mechanical coupling between molecules in a crystal is not sufficient to engineer cooperative SCO switching, if other regions of the lattice are less densely packed.",

The peak broadening in the 1H\u2005spectrum of the copper complex indicates the paramagnetic behaviour of this compound. A square-planar geometry around the nickel and copper complexes and distorted linear geometry around the mercury complex have been found. The latter geometry is attributed to the bulkiness of the methylferrocenyl and benzyl groups. The observed single quasi-reversible cyclic voltammograms for complexes 2, 8 and 9 indicate the stabilisation of a metal centre other than Fe in their characteristic oxidation state. These complexes have been used as a photosensitiser in dye-sensitised solar cells.",

    "abstract": "A combined computational and experimental study of the effects of solvent, temperature and stereochemistry on the magnitude of the through-space spin\u2013spin coupling between 31P and 19F nuclei which are six-bonds apart is described. The reaction of 3-trifluoromethylsulfonyl-2,\u20322-dihydroxy-1,1\u2032-binaphthalene (3-SO2CF3-BINOL) with hexamethylphosphorous triamide (P(NMe2)3) generates a pair of N,N-dimethylphosphoramidites which are diastereomeric due to their differing relative configurations at the stereogenic phosphorous centre and the axially chiral (atropisomeric) BINOL unit. Through-space NMR coupling of the 31P and 19F nuclei of the phosphoramidite and sulfone is detected in one diastereomer only. In the analogous N,N-dimethylphosphoramidite generated from 3,3\u2032-(SO2CF3)2-BINOL only one of the diastereotopic trifluoromethylsulfone moieties couples with the 31P of the phosphoramidite. In both cases, the magnitude of the coupling is strongly modulated (up to 400\u2009%) by solvent and temperature. A detailed DFT analysis of the response of the coupling to the orientation of the CF3 moiety with respect to the P-lone pair facilitates a confident assignment of the stereochemical identity of the pair of diastereomers. The analysis shows that the intriguing effects of environment on the magnitude of the coupling can be rationalised by a complex interplay of solvent internal pressure, molecular volume and thermal access to a wider conformational space. These phenomena suggest the possibility for the design of sensitive molecular probes for local environment that can be addressed via through-space NMR coupling.",

By comprehensively exploring versatile sequential boronate esterification linkages between plural boronic acid-appended molecules and multiple hydroxyl counterparts, not only versatile supramolecular polymers but also structurally well-defined network nanostructures have been developed. In addition orthogonal interactions such as dative bonds of the boron center with Lewis bases have led to the formation of hierarchical nano/microstructures. Boronate systems have the potential to be used as materials for smart gels, chemosensors, active architectures for electronics, heterogeneous catalysts, chemical-stimulus responsive systems for drug delivery, etc. Here, we fully discuss the feasibility of the structure-directing ability of boronic acids from the standpoint of the generation of new smart materials.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with alcohols (using acid or alkaline catalysts) is well known and practiced on a commercial scale, there is plenty of scope to improve this process. The turning of a batch into a continuous process, and the use of a catalyst that is more favourable to fatty acids in the feed, are challenges of particular interest. With these objectives in mind, results are presented of experiments in which a zinc amino acid complex [ZnL2], was used as a catalyst. This was fixed onto a structured monolith support (cordierite), so as to enable the catalysts to be retained in a fixed bed. To advance this work, reaction experiments were performed in a 120\u00a0ml batch reactor, using 10\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm sections of catalyst coated monolith (1.1\u00a0mm square channels, 62\u00a0cells\u00a0cm\u22122). With a 12:1 molar ratio of methanol and rapeseed oil (triglyceride), at 195\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0bar, and using 0.3\u00a0g of zinc catalyst (coated on a monolith), it was shown that 54% of the triglyceride was converted into biodiesel. This compares very favourably with a conversion of 69% in batch experiments, when 0.3\u00a0g of the catalyst was dispersed in the solution in the form of a very fine powder. Interestingly, it was also shown, that the cordierite monolith support on its own exhibited catalytic activity (27% conversion of the triglyceride).",

The experimental spectra are compared with density-functional theory calculations. It is shown that structure deriving from electronic levels with significant In or Sn $5s$ character is selectively enhanced under 6000 eV excitation. This allows us to infer that conduction band states in Sn-doped samples and states at the bottom of the valence band both contain a pronounced In $5s$ contribution. The In $3d$ core line measured at $\\text{h}\\ensuremath{\\nu}=1486.6\\text{ }\\text{eV}$ for both undoped and Sn-doped ${\\text{In}}_{2}{\\text{O}}_{3}$ display an asymmetric lineshape, and may be fitted with two components associated with screened and unscreened final states. The In $3d$ core line spectra excited at $\\text{h}\\ensuremath{\\nu}=6000\\text{ }\\text{eV}$ for the Sn-doped samples display pronounced shoulders and demand a fit with two components. The In $3d$ core line spectrum for the undoped sample can also be fitted with two components, although the relative intensity of the component associated with the screened final state is low, compared to excitation at 1486.6 eV. These results are consistent with a high concentration of carriers confined close to the surface of nominally undoped ${\\text{In}}_{2}{\\text{O}}_{3}$. This conclusion is in accord with the fact that a conduction band feature observed for undoped ${\\text{In}}_{2}{\\text{O}}_{3}$ in $\\text{Al}\\text{ }\\text{K}\\ensuremath{\\alpha}$ x-ray photoemission is much weaker than expected in hard x-ray photoemission.",

The rigidity and intrinsic microporosity of PIM-EA-TB allow (slow) substrate and product diffusion, whilst maintaining 4-benzoyloxy-TEMPO immobilised in active molecular form.",

The complexes with R\u00a0=\u00a0allyl (3f) and CH2CH(CH2CH\u00a0=\u00a0CH2)2 (3h) have been characterised by X-ray crystallography. Addition of HX or X2 (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl or Br) across the double bonds of the complexed ligand gives access to \u00ce\u00b2- and \u00ce\u00b3-branched N-substituents containing three to twelve organic halogen atoms. The complexes with R\u00a0=\u00a0CH2CHBrCH2Br (3k), CH2CH2CX(nC5H11)2 (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl (3n) and Br (3o)) have been characterised by X-ray crystallography. N-substituent chlorinated complexes can also be prepared via alkyl chloride containing amines as demonstrated for a crystal structure of a complex with R\u00a0=\u00a0(CH2)3Cl (3e). Complexes with \u00ce\u00b2-branched N-substituents give high selectivity for ethylene trimerisation to 1-hexene while complexes with \u00ce\u00b3-branched N-substituents are good ethylene polymerisation catalysts. The halogenated polymerisation catalysts give higher activities than their hydrogenated analogues, especially chlorine containing species. Chlorinated trimerisation catalysts demonstrated significantly improved 1-hexene selectivities, though activity was similar to hydrogenated alternatives. This lends support to the concept of a positive \u2018halogen effect\u2019 on the catalysis.",

The system is based on a planar three-electrode structure (with a Prussian Blue based H2O2 transducer modified working electrode) bridged by a solid salt-saturated filament material (filter paper, cotton textile). Respective to the hydrogen peroxide content in the washing valve, the response of the aerosol-sensing system is linear in the concentration range of 0.1\u201310 \u03bcM, which overlaps the generally accepted H2O2 content in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), with the sensitivity of 8 A M\u20131 cm\u20132. The response to the upper limit of the calibration range is stable for more than 50 injection cycles recorded within 3 days. Both the stability and the suitable calibration range allow one to consider the reported aerosol-sensing system as a prototype for a simple (avoiding intermediate EBC collection) noninvasive diagnostic tool for pulmonary patients.",

Within the lead(II) coordination structures, ethynyl-derived C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions are consistently found to provide the dominant influence over the crystal packing, as determined by solid-state structural analysis in combination with vibrational spectroscopy. The influence of weak hydrogen-bonding effects on the crystal packing of the transition metal coordination polymers that contain lattice water and methanol molecules was found to be far less prominent, which is interpreted in terms of the greater prevalence of strong hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors forming O\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions within these crystalline lattices.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTo explore the potential of molecular gas treatment of freshly cut lithium foils in non-electrolyte-based passivation of high-energy-density Li anodes, density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the decomposition of molecular gases on metallic lithium surfaces. By combining DFT geometry optimization and Molecular Dynamics, the effects of atmospheric (N2, O2, CO2) and hazardous (F2, SO2) gas decomposition on Li(bcc) (100), (110), and (111) surfaces on relative surface energies, work functions, and emerging electronic and elastic properties are investigated.The simulations suggest that exposure to different molecular gases can be used to induce and control reconstructions of the metal Li surface and substantial changes (up to over 1\u00a0eV) in the work function of the passivated system. Contrary to the other considered gases, which form metallic adlayers, SO2 treatment emerges as the most effective in creating an insulating passivation layer for dosages \u22641 mono-layer. The substantial Li\u00a0\u2192\u00a0adsorbate charge transfer and adlayer relaxation produce marked elastic stiffening of the interface, with the smallest change shown by nitrogen-treated adlayers.",

The materials crystallize in the tetragonal space groups P4/nmm (Sr2MnO3Cl) and I4/mmm (Sr4Mn3O8-yCl2) and the structures are analogous to the n = 1 and n = 3 Ruddlesden\u2212Popper phases Sr2MnO4 and Ca4Mn3O10. Both materials contain layers of highly distorted Mn(III)O5Cl octahedra. Sr4Mn3O8-yCl2, in addition, has a central layer of MnO6-\u03b4 octahedra with oxygen vacancies localized within the tetragonal plane. Consequently, the average coordination of the site is reduced to a mixture of 6-fold and 5-fold and some of the Mn atoms adopt pyramidal coordination. The level of oxygen deficiency within Sr4Mn3O8-yCl2 y = 0.44 confirms the Mn valence is predominantly +3. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering (TAF) in the materials at 80 and 90 K for Sr2MnO3Cl and Sr4Mn3O8-yCl2, respectively. Antiferromagnetic order is confirmed by the presence of magnetic scattering in the low-temperature neutron diffraction data. The magnetic structure of Sr2MnO3Cl has been determined, yielding an ordered manganese moment \u03bcz = 3.74(5) \u03bcB at 2 K. In contrast, the magnetic scattering exhibited by Sr4Mn3O8-yCl2 suggests a level of magnetic frustration.  ",

Elemental analysis performed on the gel provided a molecular composition ratio of [Pb(abd)(H2O)]n (1). Viewing the gel by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) identified an entangled network of cross-linked nano-fibres. 1H-NMR aliquots of hydrated lead(II) acetate added to a solution of H2abd in deuterated DMF allows inferences to be made about solution-state behaviour that occurs during the initial gel aggregation stage. Under non-solvothermal conditions, combining H2abd and hydrated lead(II) acetate resulted in formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction, which were identified as a 3D coordination polymer with composition [Pb(abd)(DMF)] (2). Structural features observed within this 3D coordination polymer provide the basis for assigning the molecular structure to the fibrils present within gel 1. This assertion is supported by comparable vibrational profiles taken from a sample of dried gel 1 to that of crystalline 2, and the matching of early solution-state 1H-NMR spectroscopic trends to later solid-state observations.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The materials consist of truncated Pb4Fe3O8 triple perovskite blocks separated by a CsCl-type Pb2X (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl or Br) layer. The basal oxygen of the central FeO6 octahedra exhibits disorder consistent with alternate clockwise/anticlockwise rotations around the c-axis; the degree of rotation increasing upon cooling for both materials, i.e. from 10.3\u00b0 at 650\u00a0K to 12.8\u00b0 at 10\u00a0K for Pb4Fe3O8Br. The order of the Fe moments evolving as a function of temperature has allowed the TN\u00e9el (TN)\rof Pb4Fe3O8Br to be determined for the first time as 600(5)\u00a0K, a value within experimental error of the TN for Pb4Fe3O8Cl.

The materials are isostructural with the superconducting cuprate, Tl(La2.4Ba1.6)Cu2O9, crystallizing in a tetragonal unit cell, space group I4/mmm, lattice parameters a=3.8069\u20133.7667(1) \u00c5 and c=30.055\u201329.390(1) \u00c5. The compounds adopt the 1201\u20130201 intergrowth structure, consisting of layers of apex-sharing stoichiometric NiO6 octahedra connected by a TlO layer. A decrease in the cell dimensions is observed across the series, consistent with the lanthanide contraction and partial ordering of the strontium and lanthanide ions on the A cationic sites is observed. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering for two of the compounds, Tl(La2Sr2)Ni2O9 and Tl(Gd2Sr2)Ni2O9.",

    "abstract": "We show that the quasi-skutterudite superconductor ${\\mathrm{Sr}}_{3}{\\mathrm{Ir}}_{4}{\\mathrm{Sn}}_{13}$ undergoes a structural transition from a simple cubic parent structure, the $I$ phase, to a superlattice variant, the ${I}^{\\ensuremath{'}}$ phase, which has a lattice parameter twice that of the high temperature phase. We argue that the superlattice distortion is associated with a charge density wave transition of the conduction electron system and demonstrate that the superlattice transition temperature ${T}^{*}$ can be suppressed to zero by combining chemical and physical pressure. This enables the first comprehensive investigation of a superlattice quantum phase transition and its interplay with superconductivity in a cubic charge density wave system.",

A drop of an aqueous dispersion of particles is placed on the surface and water vaporizes under controlled relative humidity. Three requirements are essential for uniform coverage: particle dispersion should not contain aggregates, a weak attraction between particles and surface is needed, and evaporation rate should be low. Aggregates are removed by stirring/sonication. Weak attraction is realized by introducing cationic groups to the surface. Insight into the mechanisms of the so-called coffee stain effect is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Substitutional doping can improve the electronic properties of \u03b1-Fe2O3 for the solar photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications. Generally speaking, nonisovalent substitutional doping helps to enhance the electronic conductivity of \u03b1-Fe2O3. However, we found that the introduction of strain in the lattice, which is achieved by isovalent substitutional doping of an Al, can also improve the electronic properties. \u03b1-Fe2O3 films with the Al dopant atomic concentration varying from 0 to 10% were prepared by electrodeposition, and their performance for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production was characterized. Results indicate that the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) for \u223c0.45 at-% Al substitution increases by 2- to 3-fold over undoped samples. Density-functional theory (DFT) was utilized to interpret the experimental findings. It was shown that although no substantial change to the electronic structure, a contraction of the crystal lattice due to the isovalent replacement of Fe3+ by an Al3+ benefits the small polaron migration, resulting in an improvement in conductivity compared to the undoped samples.",

    "abstract": "The temperature dependence of the nuclear and magnetic structure of the cobalt oxychloride ${\\mathrm{Sr}}_{2}{\\mathrm{CoO}}_{3}\\mathrm{Cl}$ has been studied using neutron powder diffraction. The material crystallizes with a structure related to ${\\mathrm{K}}_{2}{\\mathrm{NiF}}_{4}$ and contains two-dimensional (2D) layers of ${\\mathrm{CoO}}_{5}$ square pyramids that are segregated along $z$ by alternate rocksalt SrCl and SrO blocks. The development of magnetic Bragg scattering indicates that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a ${T}_{\\mathrm{N}}=330(5)\\mathrm{K}.$ The phase adopts a collinear magnetic structure related to the nuclear cell by the propagation vector $\\mathbf{k}=(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},0)$ with the cobalt spins aligned along the $a$ axis of the magnetic cell. The ordered moment $\\ensuremath{\\mu}=2.82(3){\\ensuremath{\\mu}}_{\\mathrm{B}},$ refined at 3 K, is consistent with a high-spin ${(t}_{2g}^{4}{e}_{g}^{2})$ electron configuration for the Co(III) ions. The onset of long-range magnetic order is characterized by a three-dimensional transition and is accompanied by anomalous behavior in the Co environment with distinct magnetostriction effects observed in the interlayer Co to Co exchange pathways. The transition is preceded by diffuse magnetic scattering arising from short-range in-plane correlations, with significant diffuse intensity observed up to the maximum temperature studied of 378 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the onset of significant 2D interactions occurs at $T\\ensuremath{\\approx}500\\mathrm{K}.$ The diffuse intensity can be fitted using the Warren function to give a maximum in the 2D correlation length \\ensuremath{\\xi} of 40(4) \\AA{} just above ${T}_{\\mathrm{N}}.$ Below ${T}_{\\mathrm{N}}$ diffuse scattering coexists with magnetic Bragg scattering, indicating that the transition to long-range order is hindered most probably due to the presence of stacking disorder between the antiferromagnetic sheets.",

Taking rocksalt structured PbTe(001) as the substrate, we explore the coherent (001)-oriented heteroepitaxy of the other five IV-VI semiconductors through first-principles electronic structure calculations. We investigate the effects of lattice strain and its relationship to the interface energy, as well as the electron redistribution, as a function of the epilayer thickness [from 1 to 5 monolayers (ML)] below the dislocation critical point. Analysis of the chemical bonding explains trends including work function shifts and surface rumpling. Among the five combinations studied SnTe/PbTe(001) has the smallest lattice mismatch, resulting in the most stable coherent interface and unique charge transfer behavior. Here, we perform orbital-resolved band structure calculations (with spin-orbit coupling effects) for the SnTe/PbTe(001) system, highlighting its potential use in topological spintronic thin-film devices.",

In this article, we take inspiration from this biogenic strategy to generate composite crystals in which magnetite (Fe3O4) and zincite (ZnO) nanoparticles are embedded within a calcite single crystal host, thereby endowing it with new magnetic or optical properties. While growth of crystals in the presence of small molecules, macromolecules and particles can lead to their occlusion within the crystal host, this approach requires particles with specific surface chemistries. Overcoming this limitation, we here precipitate crystals within a nanoparticle-functionalised xyloglucan gel, where gels can also be incorporated within single crystals, according to their rigidity. This method is independent of the nanoparticle surface chemistry and as the gel maintains its overall structure when occluded within the crystal, the nanoparticles are maintained throughout the crystal, preventing, for example, their movement and accumulation at the crystal surface during crystal growth. This methodology is expected to be quite general, and could be used to endow a wide range of crystals with new functionalities.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe importance of C\u2013H bond activation in a simple molecule to form a molecule with enhanced functionality can be easily understood from a study of biological processes at a molecular level where, for example, a specific enzyme selectively activates a chemically inert C\u2013H bond and functionalizes it to a useful product. This strategy is now being used for large scale industrial processes and has both social and environmental benefits. C\u2013H bond functionalization is also of major importance in catalysis because of the possibility of constructing complex structural motifs from relatively simple precursors. However, functionalization of a chemically inert C\u2013H bond needs specific catalysts or reaction conditions that can selectively activate a particular C\u2013H bond, leaving others intact. To achieve this target, various metal catalyzed or mediated reactions have been employed. Keeping the growing importance of this emerging field in mind, we now present recent advances in the field of C\u2013H activation and functionalization using group 10 transition metal catalysts. Attempts have also been made to discuss the future of group 10 transition metals in catalysis.",

Here we present a new approach in this direction by introducing a thin hydrogel layer as a soft \u2018cushion\u2019 on indium\u2013tin oxide (ITO), providing a smooth, functional surface to form the protein-tethered BLM (ptBLM). ITO was used as a transparent electrode, enabling simultaneous implementation of electrochemical and optical waveguide techniques. The hydrogel poly(N-(2-hydroxyethyl)acrylamide-co-5-acrylamido-1-carboxypentyl-iminodiacetate-co-4-benzoylphenyl methacrylate) (P(HEAAm-co-NTAAAm-co-MABP)) was functionalized with the nickel chelating nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) groups, to which cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) from Paracoccus denitrificans was bound in a well defined orientation via a his-tag attached to its subunit I. Given that the mesh size of P(HEAAm-co-NTAAAm-co-MABP) was smaller than the protein size, binding to the hydrogel occurred only on the top of the layer. The lipid bilayer was formed around the protein by in situdialysis. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed good electrical sealing properties with a resistance of \u223c1 M\u03a9 cm2. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance optical waveguide spectroscopy (SPR/OWS) indicated an increased anisotropy of the system after formation of the lipid bilayer. Cyclic voltammetry in the presence of reduced cytochrome c demonstrated that CcO was incorporated into the gel-supported ptBLM in a functionally active form.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

CuI-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation reaction between trans-[(Ph)(Et3P)2PtCl] and the terminal di-alkynes 1b\u20132b in iPr2NH/CH2Cl2 (2:1 mole ratio) gives the Pt(II) di-ynes trans-[(Et3P)2(Ph)Pt\u2013CC\u2013R\u2013CC\u2013Pt(Ph)(Et3P)2] 1M\u20132M while the dehydrohalogenation polycondensation reaction between trans-[(nBu3P)2PtCl2] and 1b\u20132b (1:1 mole ratio) under similar reaction conditions affords the Pt(II) poly-ynes trans-[Pt(PnBu3)2\u2013CC\u2013R\u2013CC-]n1P\u20132P. The di-ynes and poly-ynes have been characterized spectroscopically and, for 1M and 2M, by single-crystal X-ray which confirms the \u201crigid rod\u201d di-yne backbone. The materials possess excellent thermal stability, are soluble in common organic solvents and readily cast into thin films. Optical absorption spectroscopic measurements reveal that the EDOT spacers create stronger donor-acceptor interactions between the platinum(II) centres and conjugated ligands along the rigid backbone of the organometallic polymers compared to the related non-fused and fused oligothiophene spacers.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that in each complex the metal displays a distorted tetrahedral geometry surrounded by the four N atoms of the two sterically hindered substituted tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), calculations were used to study the ground state properties and interpret the absorption spectra for these Cu(I) complexes. The calculations show that the lowest-energy excitations of all complexes are dominated by d\u00cf\u0080(Cu)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u00cf\u0080\u2217(L), metal-to-ligand charge transfer, (MLCT) excitations. Electronic difference density maps (EDDMs) were calculated, indicating the change of electron density in the singlet excited states. The degree of filling of the coordination sphere (G parameter) by the ligands was calculated taking into account the ligand\u2013ligand overlap, and compared to the related bis(2,9-disubstituted phenanthroline) Cu(I) complexes.",

The crystals also undergo a separate phase transition near 205\u2005K, involving a contraction of the unit-cell a axis to one-third of its original value (high-temperature phase\u20051; Pbcn, Z=12; low-temperature phase\u20052; Pbcn, Z=4). The SCO-active phase\u20051 contains two unique molecular environments, one of which appears to undergo SCO more gradually than the other. In contrast, powder samples of 1 retain phase\u20051 between 140\u2013300\u2005K, although their SCO behaviour is essentially identical to the single crystals. The compounds [Fe(bppBr)2][BF4]2 (2; bppBr=4-bromo-2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) and [Fe(bppI)2][BF4]2 (3; bppI=4-iodo-2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)-pyridine) exhibit more gradual SCO near room temperature, and adopt phase\u20052 in both spin states. Comparison of 1\u20133 reveals that the more cooperative spin transition in 1, and its separate crystallographic phase transition, can both be attributed to an intermolecular steric interaction involving the methylsulfanyl substituents. All three compounds exhibit the light-induced excited-spin-state trapping (LIESST) effect with T(LIESST=70\u201380\u2005K), but show complicated LIESST relaxation kinetics involving both weakly cooperative (exponential) and strongly cooperative (sigmoidal) components.",

Difference Fourier maps suggested the presence of unfitted nuclear density (negative for H2O treated samples and positive for D2O treated samples) adjacent to the O3 and O4 sites, giving sensible O\u2013H/D distances. The results therefore indicate more than one proton site, consistent with modelling studies which suggested that there was little difference between the proton defect energies for different oxygen sites. The results indicate a mixture of inter- and intra-tetrahedra H-bonding interactions, with the shortest interaction being of the order of 2 \u00c5.

In such cases, the key defects are oxide ion vacancies, and conduction proceeds via a simple vacancy hopping mechanism. In recent years, there has been growing interest in alternative structure types, many of which contain tetrahedral moieties. For\u00a0these new systems, an understanding of the accommodation of defects and the nature of the conduction mechanism is important for the optimisation of their conductivities, as well as to help target related structures that may display\u00a0high oxide ion/proton conduction. Computer modelling studies on a range of systems containing tetrahedral\u00a0moieties are presented, including apatite-type La9.33+xGe6O26+3x/2, cuspidine-type La4Ga2\u2013xTixO9+x/2 and La1\u2013xBa1+xGaO4\u2013x/2. The type of anion defect (vacancy or interstitial), their location and the factors affecting their incorporation are discussed. In addition, modelling data to help to understand their conduction mechanisms are presented, showing novel aspects including the important role of the tetrahedral moieties in the conduction processes.",

Structure\u2013activity studies of the complexes, including X-ray crystallography data, in conjunction with mass spectrometry experiments, are used to support a proposed dinuclear mechanism. The initial rate of copolymerisation, determined using in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy, shows a first order dependence on both the catalyst concentration and the concentration of cyclohexene oxide. A dinuclear mechanism is proposed in which catalysis occurs on the convex face of the molecule, leading to chain growth from a single site.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the formation of intrinsic defects in CeO2 using density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) corrected for on-site Coulombic interactions (GGA+U). We employed an ab initio fitting procedure to determine a U{O2p} value that satisfies a Koopmans-like condition and obtained a value of U{O2p} = 5.5 eV. We subsequently demonstrated that by applying GGA+U to the O2p states, in addition to the Ce4f states, we were able to model localized holes in addition to localized electrons, thus improving the description of p-type defects in CeO2. Our results show that under oxygen-poor conditions the defects with the lowest formation energy are oxygen vacancies, while oxygen interstitials, which form peroxide ions, will be more favorable under oxygen-rich conditions. We carried out temperature and pressure dependence analyses to determine the relative abundance of intrinsic defects under real-world conditions and determined that oxygen vacancies will always be the dominant defect. Furthermore, we determined that at the dilute limit none of the defects studied can account for the intrinsic ferromagnetism that has been observed in nanosized CeO2.",

Their structures are formed from infinite sheets of linked oxopolyhedra of the stoichiometry [MP2O7]2\u2212 with potassium cations situated between the layers. The MO4 tetrahedra share oxygen atoms with [P2O7]4\u2212 diphosphate groups and the potassium ions have KO8 square prismatic geometry. In both compounds the M(II) centre has an unusual strongly flattened, tetrahedral coordination to oxygen, as a result of the Jahn\u2013Teller (JT) effect for the high spin d6 Fe(II) and p-orbital mixing or a second order JT effect for d9 Cu(II) centres in four fold coordination. The uncommon transition metal ion environments found in these materials are reflected in their optical absorption spectra and magnetism data.",

    "abstract": "Liquid|liquid interfaces provide a natural boundary and a reactive interface where an organic phase is in contact with an aqueous analyte. The selectivity of ion transfer processes at liquid|liquid interfaces can help to provide sensitivity, introduce reactive reagents, or allow analyte accumulation at the electrode surface. In this study, microdroplet deposits of the organic liquid 4-(3-phenylpropyl)-pyridine (PPP) with the ferrocenylmethyl-dodecyldimethylammonium+ (FDA+) redox system are deposited onto a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode and employed to transfer anions from the aqueous into the organic phase. A clear trend of more hydrophobic anions transferring more readily (at more negative potentials) is observed and an ESI-mass spectrometry method is developed to confirm the transfer. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic oxidation of sulfite, SO32\u2212, within the organic phase and in the presence of different electrolyte anions is investigated. Competition between sulfite transfer and inert anion transfer occurs. The electrocatalytic sulfite oxidation is suppressed in the presence of PF6\u2212 and occurs most readily in the presence of the hydrophilic nitrate anion. The resulting process can be classified as an electrocatalytic EIC\u2032-process (E: electron transfer; I: ion transfer; C: chemical reaction step). The effectiveness of the electrocatalytic process is limited by i) competition during anion transfer and ii) the liquid|liquid interface acting as a diffusion barrier. The analytical sensitivity of the method is limited to ca. 100\u2005\u03bcM SO32\u2212 (or ca. 8\u2005ppm) and potential approaches for improvement of this limit are discussed.",

The application of alumina to the ozonation system doubled the efficiency of NOM removal from water when compared to ozonation alone. Furthermore, catalytic ozonation resulted in lower by-products and biodegradable organic carbon formation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA 5-month monitoring program was undertaken in South Wales in the UK to determine the fate of 55 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) in two contrasting wastewater plants utilising two different wastewater treatment technologies: activated sludge and trickling filter beds. The impact of treated wastewater effluent on the quality of receiving waters was also assessed.PPCPs were found to be present at high loads reaching 10\u00a0kg\u00a0day\u22121 in the raw sewage. Concentrations of PPCPs in raw sewage were found to correlate with their usage/consumption patterns in Wales and their metabolism. The efficiency of the removal of PPCPs was found to be strongly dependent on the technology implemented in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In general, the WWTP utilising trickling filter beds resulted in, on average, less than 70% removal of all 55 PPCPs studied, while the WWTP utilising activated sludge treatment gave a much higher removal efficiency of over 85%. The monitoring programme revealed that treated wastewater effluents were the main contributors to PPCPs concentrations (up to 3\u00a0kg of PPCPs\u00a0day\u22121) in the rivers studied. Bearing in mind that in the cases examined here the WWTP effluents were also major contributors to rivers' flows (dilution factor for the studied rivers did not exceed 23 times) the effect of WWTP effluent on the quality of river water is significant and cannot be underestimated.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe presence and fate of 56 pharmaceuticals, personal care products, endocrine disruptors and illicit drugs (PPCPs) were investigated in the South Wales region of the UK. Two contrasting rivers: River Taff and River Ely were chosen for this investigation and were monitored for a period of 10 months. The impact of the factors affecting the levels of concentration of PPCPs and illicit drugs in surface water such as surrounding area, proximity to wastewater effluent and weather conditions, mainly rainfall was also investigated.Most PPCPs were frequently found in river water at concentrations reaching single \u00ce\u00bcg\u00a0L\u22121 and their levels depended mainly on the extent of water dilution resulting from rainfall. Discharge of treated wastewater effluent into the river course was found to be the main cause of water contamination with PPCPs. The most frequently detected PPCPs represent the group of pharmaceuticals dispensed at the highest levels in the Welsh community. These were antibacterial drugs (trimethoprim, erythromycin-H2O and amoxicillin), anti-inflammatories/analgesics (paracetamol, tramadol, codeine, naproxen, ibuprofen and diclofenac) and antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Only four PPCPs out of 56 (simvastatin, pravastatin, digoxin and digoxigenin) were not quantified over the course of the study. Several PPCPs were found to be both ubiquitous and persistent in the aqueous environment (e.g. erythromycin-H2O, codeine, carbamazepine, gabapentin and valsartan). The calculated average daily loads of PPCPs indicated that in total almost 6\u00a0kg of studied PPCPs are discharged daily into the studied rivers.The illicit drugs studied were found in rivers at low levels of ng\u00a0L\u22121. Average daily loads of amphetamine, cocaine and its main metabolite benzoylecgonine were as follows: 8, 1.2 and 39\u00a0g\u00a0day\u22121, respectively. Their frequent occurrence in surface water is primarily associated with their high illegal usage and is strongly associated with the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater effluent.",

Solid-phase extraction on Oasis HLB sorbent used for sample clean-up and concentration of analytes resulted in very good recoveries accounting for >70%. Signal suppression during MS analysis was negligible for most studied analytes. Resolution of enantiomers of chiral drugs was found to be higher than 1. Preliminary assay validation was undertaken. The mean correlation coefficients of the calibration curves, which were on average higher than 0.997 for all studied analytes, showed good linearity of the method in the studied range. Intra- and inter-day repeatabilities were on average less than 5%. The method quantification limits in wastewater were at low ppt levels and varied from 2.25 to 11.75\u00a0ng/L. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of raw and treated wastewater samples collected from four wastewater treatment plants. A common occurrence of 1R,2S (\u2212)-ephedrine, 1S,2S (+)-pseudoephedrine and venlafaxine in both raw and treated wastewater samples was observed. Amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA and MDEA were also detected in several wastewater samples. The study of enantiomeric fractions of these chiral drugs proved their variable non-racemic composition. The influence of wastewater treatment processes on the enantiomeric composition of chiral drugs was also noted and might indicate enantioselective processes occurring during treatment, although more comprehensive research has to be undertaken to support this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPharmaceuticals and recently also illicit drugs have been recognised as emerging environmental contaminants due to their potential environmental impact: frequent occurrence, persistence and risk to aquatic life and humans. This manuscript is part one of the two-part study aiming to provide a better understanding and application of environmental data not only for environmental aims but also to meet forensic objectives. An attempt to use wastewater data is made in order to verify patterns of the usage of drugs (in particular illicit) in local communities.

The calculated usage of amphetamine denoted 2.5\u00a0g\u00a0day\u22121\u00a01000\u00a0people\u22121 and is suspected to be an overestimate. Because no analysis of enantiomers of amphetamine was undertaken, no distinction between amphetamine's legal and illicit usage could be made.",

In this paper pharmaceuticals were investigated as potential chemical indicators of water contamination with sewage. The monitoring program carried out in Wales revealed that some pharmaceuticals are particularly persistent and/or ubiquitous in contaminated river water and therefore might be considered as potential conservative or labile wastewater indicators. In particular, these include some anti-inflammatory/analgesics, antiepileptics, beta-blockers, some H2-receptor antagonists and antibacterial drugs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper explores possibilities of applying enantiomeric profiling to solving problems related to estimation of drugs usage in communities via the sewage epidemiology approach: for the identification of whether drug residue results from consumption of illicit drug or metabolism of other drugs, verification of potency of used drugs and monitoring of changing patterns of drugs abuse. Due to the very complex nature of wastewater used in sewage epidemiology, which comes from the whole community rather than one individual, verification of the above is challenging but vital in accurate estimations of drugs abuse as well as providing comprehensive information regarding drug abuse trends. The results of this study indicated that amphetamine in raw wastewater was enriched with R(\u2212)-enantiomer due to its abuse as racemate. Methamphetamine was found to be racemic or to be enriched with S(+)-enantiomer. MDMA was enriched with R(\u2212)-MDMA, which was to be expected as MDMA is abused as racemate. MDA was enriched with S(+)-enantiomer, which suggests that its presence might be associated with MDMA abuse and not intentional MDA use. Out of the four possible isomers of ephedrine only natural 1R,2S(\u2212)-ephedrine and 1S,2S(+)-pseudoephedrine were detected in raw wastewater and their diastereomeric fractions were found to be season dependent with higher contribution from 1S,2S(+)-pseudoephedrine over winter months and an enrichment with 1R,2S(\u2212)-ephedrine during the spring and summer months. These findings were accompanied by a decrease of cumulative concentration of ephedrines throughout the sampling campaign between February and August. This is a very important finding indicating that non-enantioselective measurement of ephedrine concentrations cannot be a reliable indicator of actual potency of ephedrines used.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to discuss the enantiomer-specific fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters. Several chiral drugs were studied: amphetamine-like drugs of abuse (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA), ephedrines (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine), antidepressant venlafaxine, and beta-blocker atenolol. A monitoring program was undertaken in 7 WWTPs (utilizing mainly activated sludge and trickling filters technologies) and at 6 sampling points in receiving waters over the period of 9 months. The results revealed the enantiomer-specific fate of all studied drugs during both wastewater treatment and in the aqueous environment. The extent of stereoselectivity depended on several parameters including: type of chiral drug (high stereoselectivity was recorded for atenolol and MDMA), treatment technology used (activated sludge showed higher stereoselectivity than trickling filters), and season (higher stereoselectivity was observed in the aqueous environment over the spring/summer time).",

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to the presence and significance of alumina in the natural aquatic environment and its increasing application in drinking and wastewater purification, the knowledge of the structure of alumina and its possible interactions with organic and inorganic compounds in water are of great importance. This is of particular importance in both the understanding of natural aquatic environment processes and efficient industrial applications. The chemistry of alumina reactions in water is complex. The adsorption ability of alumina towards organic and inorganic compounds might be influenced by several factors such as: surface characteristics of the adsorbent (surface area, density, pore volume, porosity, pore size distribution, pHPZC as well as mechanical strength and purity), pH of the solution, ionic strength, composition of water and the physicochemical properties of adsorbates. The aim of this paper is to give a brief review of the properties of alumina and its reactivity with organic and inorganic compounds present in aqueous solutions. It also summarises the usage of alumina and alumina supported phases in water treatment technology.",

Chronoamperometry experiments reveal (at least) two reaction stages with (i) a high onset current (ca. 30\u00a0s) with nucleation and growth of product and (ii) a first-order transport-controlled reaction (ca. 5\u00a0min) leading to bulk conversion. It is shown that the type of TEMPO derivative and the pH (but not the TEMPO concentration) affect the reaction rate. The 4-acetamido-TEMPO derivative is the most effective mediator.",

Extensive research has been undertaken over the recent years to understand their environmental fate and toxicity. The one very important phenomenon that has been overlooked by environmental researchers studying the fate of pharmacologically active compounds in the environment is their chirality. Chiral drugs can exist in the form of enantiomers, which have similar physicochemical properties but differ in their biological properties such as distribution, metabolism and excretion, as these processes (due to stereospecific interactions of enantiomers with biological systems) usually favour one enantiomer over the other. Additionally, due to different pharmacological activity, enantiomers of chiral drugs can differ in toxicity. Furthermore, degradation of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in the environment can be stereoselective and can lead to chiral products of varied toxicity. The distribution of different enantiomers of the same chiral drug in the aquatic environment and biota can also be stereoselective. Biological processes can lead to stereoselective enrichment or depletion of the enantiomeric composition of chiral drugs. As a result the very same drug might reveal different activity and toxicity and this will depend on its origin and exposure to several factors governing its fate in the environment. In this critical review a discussion of the importance of chirality of pharmacologically active compounds in the environmental context is undertaken and suggestions for directions in further research are made. Several groups of chiral drugs of major environmental relevance are discussed and their pharmacological action and disposition in the body is also outlined as it is a key factor in developing a full understanding of their environmental occurrence, fate and toxicity. This review will be of interest to environmental scientists, especially those interested in issues associated with environmental contamination with pharmacologically active compounds and chiral pollutants. As the review will outline current state of knowledge on chiral drugs, it will be of value to anyone interested in the phenomenon of chirality, chiral drugs, their stereoselective disposition in the body and environmental fate (212 references).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Optimum sensitization was achieved by careful adjustment of the surface charges of TiO2 and PbS QDs by controlling the pH of the QD solution. Efficient electron transfer from photoexcited PbS QDs via the GSH ligands into the conduction band of TiO2 was demonstrated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of PbS-sensitized P25 nanoparticles. The PbS QD-sensitized porous TiO2 electrodes were used to prepare quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) utilizing a CuxSy counter electrode and aqueous polysulfide electrolyte. Cells with up to 64% injection efficiency, 1.1% AM 1.5 conversion efficiency, and short circuit current density of 7.4 mA cm\u20132 were obtained. The physical parameters of the cells were investigated using impedance spectroscopy.",

In combination with the reversed Wentzel\u2212Kramers\u2212Brillouin and Bruggeman effective medium approximation and by modeling the hydrogel film as a composite of sublayers with individual complex refractive indices, refractive index/volume fraction gradient profiles perpendicular to the surface are accessible simultaneously with information about local inhomogeneities. Specifically, the imaginary refractive index \u03ba of each sublayer can be interpreted as a measure for static and dynamic inhomogeneities, which were found to be highest at the volume transition collapse temperature in the layer center. These results indicate that the hydrogel collapse originates rather from the film center than from its boundaries. Upon addition of NaCl to a swollen hydrogel below its transition temperature, comparable optical loss characteristics as for the thermal gel collapse are observed with respect to inhomogeneities. Interestingly, in contrast to the thermally induced layer shrinkage and collapse, swelling increases at intermediate salt concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The reaction kinetics of the copolymerization of carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide to produce poly(cyclohexene carbonate), catalyzed by a dizinc acetate complex, is studied by in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. A parameter study, including reactant and catalyst concentration and carbon dioxide pressure, reveals zero reaction order in carbon dioxide concentration, for pressures between 1 and 40 bar and temperatures up to 80 \u00b0C, and a first-order dependence on catalyst concentration and concentration of cyclohexene oxide. The activation energies for the formation of poly(cyclohexene carbonate) and the cyclic side product cyclohexene carbonate are calculated, by determining the rate coefficients over a temperature range between 65 and 90 \u00b0C and using Arrhenius plots, to be 96.8 \u00b1 1.6 kJ mol\u20131 (23.1 kcal mol\u20131) and 137.5 \u00b1 6.4 kJ mol\u20131 (32.9 kcal mol\u20131), respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 1H NMR spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry are employed to study the poly(cyclohexene carbonate) produced, and reveal bimodal molecular weight distributions, with narrow polydispersity indices (\u22641.2). In all cases, two molecular weight distributions are observed, the higher value being approximately double the molecular weight of the lower value; this finding is seemingly independent of copolymerization conversion or reaction parameters. The copolymer characterization data and additional experiments in which chain transfer agents are added to copolymerization experiments indicate that rapid chain transfer reactions occur and allow an explanation for the observed bimodal molecular weight distributions. The spectroscopic and kinetic analyses enable a mechanism to be proposed for both the copolymerization reaction and possible side reactions; a dinuclear copolymerization active site is implicated.",

The Hf(IV) complexes are all active for the ROP of rac-lactide in the melt, with the fluxional meso complex affording a strong isotactic bias Pm = 0.84. As expected Hf(3)(OiPr)2 polymerised L-LA faster than rac-LA (kapp = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121vs. 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121). For Ti(IV) complexes atactic PLA was formed.

Al(1)(OiPr) was fluxional on the NMR timescale, whereas Al(3)(OiPr) was locked in solution with no exchange. Interestingly, the Al(III) complexes of 3H2 produce PLA with a very strong heterotactic bias Pr upto 0.87, whereas atactic PLA is produced with 1H2.

The highest selectivity observed was 67%. The catalysts have been characterised via29Si solid-state NMR spectroscopy, TEM, XPS, pXRD and nitrogen adsorption studies. Different silica materials have been investigated as supports and there appears to be a relationship between the pore diameter and the selectivity to 1,3-butadiene. When the same metals were impregnated on non-acidic supports the conversion dramatically reduced.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

All eight complexes have been characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. It was shown that for L1H and L2H trimetallic complexes of the form Zn3(OAc)4(L1\u20132)2 were isolated. However, for L3H to L7H monometallic complexes were formed, Zn(L3\u20137)2. For L8H a trimetallic complex was also isolated with the same stoichiometry as Zn3(OAc)4(L1\u20132)2 but a different coordination motif was detected. The Schiff base ligand L1H was anchored to silica and treated with Zn(OAc)2\u00b72H2O to form the heterogeneous ZnII system. This was characterised by 13C{1H} CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy. All homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts were assessed for the ring-opening polymerisation of rac-lactide at 130 \u00b0C in the absence of solvent, using unsublimed monomer.

We demonstrate their ability to predict, quickly and accurately, the glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of linear homopolymers. A variety of multilayer, feed-forward artificial neural networks were trained to predict the Tg values of the polymers from their monomer structures using the error back-propagation method. The networks were constructed using the PlaNet and Aspirin/Migraines software. The networks were trained using 360 example monomer structures and tested on an independent set of 89 different monomer structures. In these initial trials, the best networks were able to predict the Tg values for a testing set of polymers with a wide range of structures with an rms error of ca. 35 K based on monomer structure information alone, with no additional information included about the polymers.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

These all contain short, strong O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds and a recurring acid\u22efamide heterodimer forming U\u2013A\u2013U synthons. Despite differences in the degree of saturation of the linking C\u2013C groups of the di-carboxylic acids and the single or double methyl substitution of one of the N atoms of the urea, the packing arrangements are remarkably similar in five of the complexes; the exceptions being N-methylurea oxalic acid and N,N-dimethylurea fumaric acid. The five similar molecular complexes all show contraction of one unit cell parameter on increasing temperature due to rearrangements of the weaker interactions which hold together the U\u2013A\u2013U units. The strength of the short, strong O\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bond is shown to be linked both to the length of the connecting bridge between the carboxylic acid groups of the acid, and to the \u0394pKa values between the two components.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The carboxylic acid dimer is a frequently observed intermolecular association used in crystal engineering and design, which can show proton disorder across its hydrogen bonds. Proton disorder in benzoic acid dimers is a dynamic, temperature-dependent process whose reported occurrence is still relatively rare. A combination of variable temperature X-ray and neutron diffraction has been applied to demonstrate the effect of local crystalline environment on both the degree and onset of proton disorder in 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid dimers. Dimers which have significantly asymmetric local intermolecular interactions are found to have a higher onset temperature for occupation of a second hydrogen atom site to be observed, indicating a greater energy asymmetry between the two configurations. Direct visualization of the electron density of hydrogen atoms within these dimers using high resolution X-ray diffraction data to characterize this disorder is shown to provide remarkably good agreement with that derived from neutron data.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConcentrations of metabolites of illicit drugs in sewage water can be measured with great accuracy and precision, thanks to the development of sensitive and robust analytical methods. Based on assumptions about factors including the excretion profile of the parent drug, routes of administration and the number of individuals using the wastewater system, the level of consumption of a drug can be estimated from such measured concentrations. When presenting results from these \u2018back-calculations\u2019, the multiple sources of uncertainty are often discussed, but are not usually explicitly taken into account in the estimation process. In this paper we demonstrate how these calculations can be placed in a more formal statistical framework by assuming a distribution for each parameter involved, based on a review of the evidence underpinning it. Using a Monte Carlo simulations approach, it is then straightforward to propagate uncertainty in each parameter through the back-calculations, producing a distribution for instead of a single estimate of daily or average consumption. This can be summarised for example by a median and credible interval. To demonstrate this approach, we estimate cocaine consumption in a large urban UK population, using measured concentrations of two of its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and norbenzoylecgonine. We also demonstrate a more sophisticated analysis, implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our model allows the two metabolites to simultaneously inform estimates of daily cocaine consumption and explicitly allows for variability between days. After accounting for this variability, the resulting credible interval for average daily consumption is appropriately wider, representing additional uncertainty. We discuss possibilities for extensions to the model, and whether analysis of wastewater samples has potential to contribute to a prevalence model for illicit drug use.",

    "abstract": " Apatite-type oxides of general formula La9.33+x(SiO4)6O2 + 3x/2 have been attracting considerable interest recently because of their observed high oxide-ion conductivity and potential use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen sensors, and ceramic membranes. In this paper, computer modeling techniques are used to investigate, at the atomic level, the energetics of defect formation, oxide-ion migration, and cation migration in the oxygen-excess apatite silicate, La9.67(SiO4)6O2.5. Recent research has suggested that oxide-ion conduction in these apatite systems proceeds by an interstitial mechanism. Our results support this view and have revealed how the flexibility of the SiO4 substructure plays a crucial role in facilitating oxide-ion migration: the presence of interstitial oxide ions creates pseudo-\u201cSiO5\u201d units, which can effectively pass along the c direction by oxygen transfer. La vacancy migration is also examined and, as expected, found to have a high energy barrier.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe here report the development of an aptamer based biosensor for the investigation of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker found in blood for prostate cancer (PCa), using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The study concentrates on a clinical application where a specific and sensitive label-free detection could be performed in real blood samples using EIS. Two types of PSA aptasensor were fabricated by immobilizing (i) a self-assembled monolayer comprising of 6-mercaptohexanol (MCH) and thiolated-DNA aptamer and (ii) 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid for covalent immobilization of amine terminated DNA aptamers and sulfo-betaine terminated thiol as an antifouling agent on a polycrystalline gold surface. Upon incubation of PSA with the DNA aptamer-based biosensor a decrease of charge transfer resistance (Rct) was observed due to the partial screening of the DNA aptamer charge by PSA. Thiol terminated sulfo-betaine based sensors can detect PSA levels lower than 1\u00a0ng/ml. Validation of the aptasensor is provided by surface plasmon resonance measurements. Sulfo-betaine moiety also prevents any significant non-specific binding of the control protein human serum albumin (HSA) as compared to high non-specific binding with MCH-based sensors. A debate is presented on the effect of the measurement buffer on the values and the direction of Rct changes on the aptasensors and the need to cautiously select suitable measurement conditions in order to obtain reliable results. This is the first report to date where a DNA aptamer-based biosensor was developed using thiol-terminated sulfo-betaine, which is a simple surface chemistry for the development of promising, cost-effective, label-free and sensitive electrochemical detection platforms for a range of analytes.",

This emphasises the subtle features of the hydrogen bond potential well in such short hydrogen bonded complexes, both intrinsically and in the effect of the local crystalline environment. Based on these findings, the synthesis and analysis of a series of solid-state molecular complexes is shown to be a potential route to designing materials with tuneable proton migration effects.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

This has allowed the effect of introducing gallium and germanium onto the framework sites to be studied. The framework expansion associated with gallium and germanium incorporation is principally accommodated by co-operative rotations about the axis and an increase in framework T\u2013O\u2013T bond angle. Correlations involving structural parameters such as framework T\u2013O\u2013T bond angle, T\u2013O bond lengths and tetrahedral tilt angle have been examined and have been shown to be analogous to those found for their aluminosilicate counterparts. \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The structure of 1 consists of dimers, [Me2Cd\u00b7H2NN(CH2)4O]2, which form six-membered Cd2N4 rings, linked into 1-D chains by CdMe2 moieties coordinated to the oxygen of the morpholine ring. 2 is a tetramer embodying a Cd4N8 cage analogous to related organozinc hydrazides, but unlike the latter, each metal center has the same coordination environment. Hydrolysis of 2 gives [MeCdN(H)N(CH2)4O]3[MeCdOH] (3), which is isostructural with its known zinc analogue.

    "abstract": " The novel methylcadmium aminoalkoxides MeCd(dmae) (Hdmae = dimethylaminoethanol), MeCd(bdmap) [Hbdmap = 1,3-bis-(dimethylamino)-propan-2-ol], and MeCd(tdmap) [tdmap = 1,3-bis(dimethylamino)-2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-propan-2-ol] have been synthesized and structurally characterized. MeCd(dmae) (1) forms a tetrameric heterocubane with a Cd4O4 core, while MeCd(bdmap) (2) is trimeric and MeCd(tdmap) (3) is a dimer. Only in the case of MeCd(dmae) are all the ligand donors fully utilized. In solution, MeCd(tdmap) undergoes a Schlenk equilibrium, with Me2Cd and Cd(tdmap)2 evident at 218 K. The structure and solution-state chemistry of Cd(tdmap)2 (5) have been independently studied and, in the solid-state, found to exist as a dimer whose coordination number at cadmium (CN = 6) is greater than in the organocadmium complexes (CN = 4, 5). MeCd(tdmap) has been used as a single-source precursor for CdO films by LPCVD with a glass substrate temperature of only 140 \u00b0C. Evidence is also presented for the formation of a heterometallic precursor, [(MeZn)(MeCd)(tdmap)2] (6), which has been used to deposit films of CdO mixed with ZnO by LPCVD at 140 \u00b0C. The structure of Me4Cd4(tdmap)2Cl2 (4), obtained serendipitously, is also included.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the structure to be a hydrogen bonded dimer. Reaction of Al(OiPr)3 (or AlMe3) with L1H3 in THF affords the related, and structurally characterised THF adduct, [THF\u00b7Al(L1)]. Similar reaction of Al(OiPr)3 (or AlMe3) with the bis-phenol amine and tetra-phenol diamine ligands, L2H3 and L3H4, results in the formation and isolation of the complexes [Al(L2)]2 and [Al(L3)H] respectively, both of which have been structurally characterised viasingle crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Reaction of the alkoxide bridged dimer [Al(L2)]2 with the strong Lewis base HMPA results in the formation of the monomeric HMPA adduct [HMPA\u00b7Al(L2)] which was also structurally characterised.

Ionic conductivity in the sodalite structure is primarily influenced by the potential barrier of the intercage bottleneck which is controlled by the size of the six-membered window in relation to the dimension of the mobile cations. The size of this bottleneck may be easily controlled by the anion size.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Levels of AMACR are increased in prostate and other cancers, and it is a drug target. Development of AMACR as a drug target is hampered by lack of a convenient assay. AMACR irreversibly catalyses the elimination of HF from 3-fluoro-2-methylacyl-CoA substrates, and this reaction was investigated for use as an assay. Several known inhibitors and alternative substrates reduced conversion of 3-fluoro-2-methyldecanoyl-CoA by AMACR, as determined by 1H NMR. The greatest reduction of activity was observed with known potent inhibitors. A series of novel acyl-CoA esters with aromatic side chains were synthesised for testing as chromophoric substrates. These acyl-CoA esters were converted to unsaturated products by AMACR, but their use was limited by non-enzymatic elimination. Fluoride sensors were also investigated as a method of quantifying released fluoride and thus AMACR activity. These sensors generally suffered from high background signal and lacked reproducibility under the assay conditions. In summary, the elimination reaction can be used to characterise inhibitors, but it was not possible to develop a convenient colorimetric or fluorescent assay using 3-fluoro-2-methylacyl-CoA substrates.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

We show that SPR is able to discriminate between the adsorption of live versus dead (thermally shocked) bacteria. Moreover, the SPR distinguishes between the adsorption of wild-type versus mutant bacteria (single gene knockouts), the concentration of the bacterial suspension, and between bacteria adsorbing on SAM-modified and bare gold. SPR is able to measure bacterial adsorption within seconds of the bacterial suspension being introduced. Finally, a qualitative correlation between results from SPR with a crystal violet staining assay for different mutant bacteria was observed.",

The collection efficiency for photoinjected electrons in the cells is close to 100% under short circuit conditions, even for a 20 \u03bcm thick nanotube array. Transport, trapping, and back transfer of electrons in the nanotube cells have been studied in detail by a range of complementary experimental techniques. Analysis of the experimental results has shown that the electron diffusion length (which depends on the diffusion coefficient and lifetime of the photoinjected electrons) is of the order of 100 \u03bcm in the titania nanotube cells. This is consistent with the observation that the collection efficiency for electrons is close to 100%, even for the thickest (20 \u03bcm) nanotube films used in the study. The study revealed a substantial discrepancy between the shapes of the electron trap distributions measured experimentally using charge extraction techniques and those inferred indirectly from transient current and voltage measurements. The discrepancy is resolved by introduction of a numerical factor to account for non-ideal thermodynamic behavior of free electrons in the nanostructured titania.",

    "abstract": "Scanning probe-actuated single molecule manipulation has proven to be an exceptionally powerful tool for the systematic atomic-scale interrogation of molecular adsorbates. To date, however, the extent to which molecular conformation affects the force required to push or pull a single molecule has not been explored. Here we probe the mechanochemical response of two tetra(4-bromophenyl)porphyrin conformers using non-contact atomic force microscopy where we find a large difference between the lateral forces required for manipulation. Remarkably, despite sharing very similar adsorption characteristics, variations in the potential energy surface are capable of prohibiting probe-induced positioning of one conformer, while simultaneously permitting manipulation of the alternative conformational form. Our results are interpreted in the context of dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations which reveal significant differences in the diffusion barriers for each conformer. These results demonstrate that conformational variation significantly modifies the mechanical response of even simple porpyhrins, potentially affecting many other flexible molecules.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years there has been a growth in the use of nanoparticles for stabilizing lipid membranes that contain embedded proteins. These bionanoparticles provide a solution to the challenging problem of membrane protein isolation by maintaining a lipid bilayer essential to protein integrity and activity. We have previously described the use of an amphipathic polymer (poly(styrene-co-maleic acid), SMA) to produce discoidal nanoparticles with a lipid bilayer core containing the embedded protein. However the structure of the nanoparticle itself has not yet been determined. This leaves a major gap in understanding how the SMA stabilizes the encapsulated bilayer and how the bilayer relates physically and structurally to an unencapsulated lipid bilayer. In this paper we address this issue by describing the structure of the SMA lipid particle (SMALP) using data from small angle neutron scattering (SANS), electron microscopy (EM), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). We show that the particle is disc shaped containing a polymer \u201cbracelet\u201d encircling the lipid bilayer. The structure and orientation of the individual components within the bilayer and polymer are determined showing that styrene moieties within SMA intercalate between the lipid acyl chains. The dimensions of the encapsulated bilayer are also determined and match those measured for a natural membrane. Taken together, the description of the structure of the SMALP forms the foundation for future development and applications of SMALPs in membrane protein production and analysis.",

    "abstract": "As the chemistry of saccharides and related molecular species plays a significant role in the metabolic pathways of living organisms, detecting the presence and concentration of biologically important sugars in aqueous solution is necessary in a variety of medicinal and industrial contexts. The recognition of d-glucose is of particular interest, for example in the monitoring of diabetics. Recent research provides clear evidence that tight control of blood sugar levels in diabetics sharply reduces the risk of long term complications, which include blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and even gangrene and amputation of the limbs. Current enzymatic detection methods of sugars offer specificity for only a few saccharides; additionally, enzyme based sensors are unstable in harsh conditions. Phenylboronic acid has been known for 120 years. However, it took until 1959 for the first quantitative evaluation of saccharide boronic acid interactions. Boronic acids react with 1,2 or 1,3 diols of saccharides to form five- or six-membered cyclic esters in non-aqueous or basic aqueous media. The stable boronic acid-based saccharide receptors offer the possibility of creating saccharide sensors \u2018chemosensors\u2019 which are selective and sensitive for any chosen saccharide.",

    "abstract": "The lock-and-key principle of natural systems is based on complex interactions like hydrogen bonding. Many synthetic systems that attempt to mimic natural systems have also used hydrogen bonding as the main binding force and have met with great success in non-hydrogen-bonding solvents that do not compete with the guest for the binding pocket. In contrast, natural systems function in water, a very competitive solvent. Synthetic hydrogen-bonding systems may yet evolve to be successful in water. If this transition can not be made, synthetic answers can nevertheless take inspiration from nature without slavishly following the blue print. This is not an attempt to reinvent the \u201clock\u201d: a new locking mechanism merely replaces the existing one. The inspiration might be the view of the hydrogen bond as an easily reversible \u201ccovalent\u201d bond. Screening the literature we rediscovered boronic acids, which have been known for over 100 years. Conveniently, boronic acids rapidly and reversibly form cyclic esters with diols in basic aqueous media. Saccharides and other related \u201ckeys\u201d contain a contiguous array of cyclic alcohols. In this work we hope to demonstrate that saccharide \u201ckeys\u201d and boronic acid \u201clocks\u201d can open the door to a new and exciting field of research.",

In the single crystal the rate constant for the cycloaddition reaction was determined {k = (2.3 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121}, with a 69% conversion attained, which compares well with a two-photon irradiation experiment using a Nd:YAG laser pumped dye laser at 605 nm radiation (66% conversion). Full conversion was attained using powdered 3 after 43 h. A similar conversion was noted between the single crystal and powder forms (59% and 66% conversion after 5 h irradiation). Irradiation of monothiophos-dba in solution using a 325 nm laser, and monitoring by 1H NMR spectroscopy, showed that no cycloaddition occurred, but exclusive photochemically-induced trans \u2192 cis isomerisation of the alkene bond connecting the unsubstituted aryl group (cis \u2192 trans isomerisation in these electron-deficient and polarised CC bonds occurs rapidly by thermal equilibration).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The handling of single targets takes up a major fraction of the review, but the extension to multiple targets is also illustrated. Conceptually new channels of investigation are opened up by the latter approach, e.g. \u2018lab-on-a-molecule\u2019 systems and molecular keypad locks.

Zn(Bipy-(MMOES)2) a zinc carboxylate monomer was designed with the purpose of mimicking commercial cross linking agents such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, as well as containing antimicrobial zinc ions (Zn2+), with the intention that it can be used to cross link into any polymeric material, the example here being polyacrylic acid. Two systems were studied: a homopolymer of the Zn(Bipy-(MMOES)2) and copolymers of Zn(Bipy-(MMOES)2) with acrylic acid (AA). The AA \u2013 Zn(Bipy-(MMOES)2) produced water swellable polymers which retained antimicrobial activity. The ability of the polymers to release the zinc ions was shown to be pH responsive and the leachate analysed to give a proposed mechanism of action. The Zn(Bipy-(MMOES)2) monomer and polymers have shown antibacterial activity against both gram positive Methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 476) and gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA01).",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of specialised carbohydrate affinity ligand methacrylamido phenylboronic acid in polyacrylamide gels for fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis greatly improved the effective separation of saccharides that show similar mobilities in standard electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using methacrylamido phenylboronic acid in low loading (typically 0.5\u20131% dry weight) was unequivocally shown to alter retention of labelled saccharides depending on their boronate affinity. While conventional fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis of 2-aminoacridone labelled glucose oligomers showed an inverted parabolic migration, an undesired trait of small oligosaccharides labelled with this neutral fluorophore, boron affinity saccharide electrophoresis separation of these carbohydrates completely restored their predicted running order, based on their charge/mass ratio, and resulted in improved separation of the analyte saccharides. These results exemplify boron affinity saccharide electrophoresis as an important new technique for analysing carbohydrates and sugar-containing molecules.",

Sulfur forms a range of open and closed Sn species in the gas phase, which has led to speculation on the composition of sulfur vapours as a function of temperature and pressure for over a century. Unlike elemental gases such as O2 and N2, there is no widely accepted thermodynamic potential for sulfur. Here we combine a first-principles global structure search for the low energy clusters from S2 to S8 with a thermodynamic model for the mixed-allotrope system, including the Gibbs free energy for all gas-phase sulfur on an atomic basis. A strongly pressure-dependent transition from a mixture dominant in S2 to S8 is identified. A universal chemical potential function, \u03bcS(T,P), is proposed with wide utility in modelling sulfurisation processes including the formation and annealing of metal chalcogenide semiconductors.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The solid is produced industrially at high chemical purities by deposition from a vapor phase, and oxygen may be included at this stage. Oxidation represents a potential path for tuning its properties without introducing more exotic elements or extreme processing conditions. In this work, ab initio computational methods are used to examine the energy potentials and electronic properties of different extents of oxidation in GaN. Solid-state vibrational properties of Ga, GaN, Ga${}_{2}$O${}_{3}$, and a single substitutional oxygen defect have been studied using the harmonic approximation with supercells. A thermodynamic model is outlined which combines the results of ab initio calculations with data from experimental literature. This model allows free energies to be predicted for arbitrary reaction conditions within a wide process envelope. It is shown that complete oxidation is favorable for all industrially relevant conditions, while the formation of defects can be opposed by the use of high temperatures and a high N${}_{2}$:O${}_{2}$ ratio.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHypothesisFilm formation and film structure in films formed on solutions of cationic surfactants with polyethylenimine is influenced by the surfactant structure, including both the tail length and the nature of the headgroup, which alter the micelle properties.ExperimentsA series of cationic surfactants were synthesized and conductivity measurements were used to compare the critical micelle concentrations for these surfactants and their behaviour with and without polyethylenimine at high pH. Small angle neutron scattering measurements were used to characterise the size and shape of the micelles in the presence and absence of the polymer. Film formation between polyethylenimine and the various surfactants was trialled, and the interfacial film structures measured using neutron reflectivity.FindingsFilm formation is shown to depend on surfactant tail length, with thicker films forming for surfactants with longer hydrophobic tails. The surfactant headgroup structure affects counterion binding to the micelles, and in the case of the aromatic headgroups, the headgroup affects the extent of micellar growth when polymer is added. Films with the greatest mesostructural ordering were grown using hexadecylpyridinium bromide surfactants.",

While CZTS is composed of earth abundant and non-toxic elements, arranged in the kesterite crystal structure, there is a synthetic challenge to produce high-quality stoichiometric materials over large areas. We calculate the thermodynamic potentials of CZTS and its elemental and binary components based on energetic and vibrational data computed using density functional theory. These chemical potentials are combined to produce a thermodynamic model for the stability of CZTS under arbitrary temperatures and pressures, which provide insights into the materials chemistry. CZTS was shown to be thermodynamically stable with respect to its component elements and their major binary phases binaries under modest partial pressures of sulfur and temperatures below 1100 K. Under near-vacuum conditions with sulfur partial pressures below 1 Pa decomposition into binaries including solid SnS becomes favourable, with a strongly temperature-dependent stability window.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Major advances in rechargeable batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale grid storage will depend on the discovery and exploitation of new high performance materials, which requires a greater fundamental understanding of their properties on the atomic and nanoscopic scales. This review describes some of the exciting progress being made in this area through use of computer simulation techniques, focusing primarily on positive electrode (cathode) materials for lithium-ion batteries, but also including a timely overview of the growing area of new cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. In general, two main types of technique have been employed, namely electronic structure methods based on density functional theory, and atomistic potentials-based methods. A major theme of much computational work has been the significant synergy with experimental studies. The scope of contemporary work is highlighted by studies of a broad range of topical materials encompassing layered, spinel and polyanionic framework compounds such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and LiFePO4 respectively. Fundamental features important to cathode performance are examined, including voltage trends, ion diffusion paths and dimensionalities, intrinsic defect chemistry, and surface properties of nanostructures.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Extensive oxidation of the Cp* ligand is observed, likely beginning with electrophilic C\u2013H hydroxylation of a Cp* methyl group followed by nonselective pathways of further oxidative degradation. Evidence is presented that the supporting chelate ligand in Cp*Ir(chelate) precursors influences the course of oxidation and is neither eliminated from the coordination sphere nor oxidatively transformed. Isomeric products of initial Cp* oxidation are identified and structurally characterized by vibrational spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) modeling. Less extensive but more rapid oxidation of the cod ligand is also observed in the (cod)IrI complexes. The observations are consistent with the proposed role of Cp* and cod as sacrificial placeholder ligands that are oxidatively removed from the precursor complexes under catalytic conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study aims to investigate mechanisms of ozonation in the presence of ZSM-5 zeolites and \u00ce\u00b3-alumina in water. Four ZSM-5 zeolites with varying silica to alumina ratios and with both hydrogen and sodium counter ions were used in the study (Z1000H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a01000, Z900Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a0900, Z25H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025 and Z25Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025). The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide ion radical (oO2\u2212) was investigated during ozonation in the presence of ZSM-5 zeolites and alumina using amplex red and 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-dizole (NBD-Cl) as probe molecules. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report utilising NBD-Cl and amplex red to study mechanisms of catalytic ozonation. The results showed that alumina promotes much higher formation of ROS in aqueous solutions when compared to ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of ZSM-5 zeolites. The process was found to be pH dependent. Furthermore, alumina showed its highest activity at a pH close to its point of zero charge. The presence of tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and phosphates in the reaction solution did not have a significant effect on ROS production in the presence of ZSM-5 zeolites. However, in the case of alumina, the presence of phosphates significantly lowered ROS formation. This indicates the critical importance of surface hydroxyl groups of alumina in ozone decomposition and ROS formation. In contrast to H2O2 formation, TBA did not have a significant effect on oO2\u2212 production in the case of alumina. This suggests that oO2\u2212 plays a significant role in the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, both zeolites and alumina were found to catalyse the removal of NBD-Cl from aqueous solution. Therefore, it is suggested that alumina operates through a radical mechanism leading to the production of ROS. On the other hand, zeolites serve as reservoirs of ozone and adsorbents of organic compounds, which interact via direct ozonation pathways. The activity of zeolites depends on the silica to alumina ratios of the zeolite and is independent of the nature of the zeolite counter ions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe mechanisms of catalytic ozonation of coumarin on ZSM-5 zeolites and \u00ce\u00b3-alumina in water have been studied. Coumarin is known to react with hydroxyl radicals to produce 7-hydroxycoumarin and is used to differentiate between radical and non-radical mechanisms. The effect of the radical scavenger (t-butanol) and phosphates has also been used to study the possible involvement of radicals and the role of surface hydroxyl groups of catalysts. Four ZSM-5 zeolites with varying silica to alumina ratios and with both hydrogen and sodium counter ions were used in the study (Z1000H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a01000, Z900Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a0900, Z25H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025 and Z25Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025). The results show that both alumina and the zeolites catalyse the removal of coumarin from aqueous solution by ozonation, but that alumina is generally more active than zeolites and it catalyses a radical pathway involving hydroxyl radicals, showing its highest activity at pH close to the point of zero charge where surface hydroxyl groups are most susceptible to conversion of ozone to hydroxyl radicals. The zeolites operate through a simple adsorption process, leading to a direct reaction between adsorbed coumarin and adsorbed ozone. Activity depends to an extent on the silica to alumina ratio of the zeolite but is insensitive to the nature of the zeolite counter ion.",

Both the H-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-5 forms with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and counter ions (Z1000H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a01000, Z900Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a0900, Z25H:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025 and Z25Na:SiO2/Al2O3\u00a0=\u00a025) have been used. The effects of pH, adsorption, presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers, phosphates and humic acids on the efficiency of catalytic ozonation have been investigated. The results revealed that catalytic ozonation on zeolites could substantially enhance the removal of VOCs and ibuprofen when compared with ozonation alone and that adsorption plays a key role in the effectiveness of this process. Zeolites with high SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were found to have a high adsorption capacity towards VOCs and as a result high catalytic activity. On the other hand zeolites with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios had a high adsorption capacity towards ibuprofen in its ionised form. Catalytic processes have been found to be pH dependent with the highest activity at acidic pH. The presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers (phosphates and humic acid) did not have a significant effect on the removal of contaminants on ZSM-5 zeolites. Despite high activity towards VOCs and ibuprofen, zeolites did not catalyse the removal of acetic acid in water at studied pH values. It is therefore suggested that catalytic ozonation of organic pollutants on ZSM-5 zeolites proceeds via direct reactions of molecular ozone with pollutants adsorbed on the surface of zeolites.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis study aims to understand the efficiency and role of adsorption of common water pollutants (volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), pharmaceuticals and carboxylic acids) in the catalytic ozonation process on \u00ce\u00b3-alumina. In order to understand the catalytic processes occurring, the effects of pH, hydroxyl radical scavengers, humic acids and phosphates on the efficiency of catalytic ozonation on alumina were studied. The results revealed that catalytic ozonation on alumina could substantially enhance the removal of ibuprofen and acetic acid when compared with ozonation alone. However, alumina did not catalyse the removal of VOCs. The adsorption of pollutants plays a key role in the effectiveness of this process. The presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers, phosphates and humic acids had a significant effect on the removal of pollutants on alumina. It is therefore suggested that catalytic ozonation of organic pollutants on alumina proceeds via a radical mechanism that involves reactions of hydroxyl radicals with pollutants adsorbed on the surface of alumina.",

    "abstract": "The control of healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is of concern worldwide. Given the evidence that several pathogenic species replicate within amoebae and emerge more virulent and more resistant and the abundance of amoebae in healthcare settings, we investigated interactions of Acanthamoeba polyphaga with epidemic MRSA isolates. MRSA proliferated in the presence of amoebae, attributable partly to intracellular replication. Following 24\u00a0h of co-culture, confocal microscopy revealed that c. 50% amoebae had viable MRSA within phago-lysosomes and 2% of amoebae were heavily infected with viable cocci throughout the cytoplasm. Infection control strategies should recognize the contribution of protozoa.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCu2SnZnS4 is a promising candidate for thin film solar cells with absorbers made of non-toxic and abundant elements. So far very little effort has been put into understanding the basic material properties. We investigate vapour phase grown Cu2SnZnS4 crystals by temperature and intensity dependent photoluminescence measurements. We observe for the first time narrow photoluminescence peaks, which allow us to determine defect levels and to propose a defect recombination model for Cu2SnZnS4. Assuming an exciton binding energy of 10\u00a0meV, we find an energy gap of 1.519\u00a0eV at 10\u00a0K. From the observed DA transitions we derive the energies of two shallow acceptor states 10\u00b15 and 30\u00b15\u00a0meV above the valence band and one shallow donor state 5\u00b13\u00a0meV below the conduction band.",

In solution environments these redox-active nanoparticles provide chemically stable and pH-sensitive voltammetirc responses (reversible 2-electron 2-proton oxidation) over a pH range from 2 to 12.When mixed into Dowex 50 Wx4 cation exchanger or Dowex 50 1x2 anion exchanger and placed in contact with a glassy carbon electrode in a flow of humidified gas, the l-dopa-boc-modified carbon nanoparticles provide pH-sensitive surface probes to monitor the surface conditions. In a two-terminal cell it is demonstrated that gas flow measurements are possible with both modified cation and anion exchanger particles in contact to glassy carbon electrodes. The anion exchanger particles allow pH control after pre-conditioning in phosphate buffer. Loading-dependent sensitivity to ammonia gas is investigated and high sensitivity to ammonia is observed for Dowex 50 1x2 anion exchanger pre-equilibrated in phosphate buffer pH 3 and decorated with l-dopa-boc-modified carbon nanoparticles. Responses are observed with sequential injections of 1\u00a0cm3 ammmonia into a gas flow-through device.",

    "abstract": "Large area lipid bilayers, on solid surfaces, are useful in physical studies of biological membranes. It is advantageous to minimize the interactions of these bilayers with the substrate and this can be achieved via the formation of a floating supported bilayer (FSB) upon either a surface bound phospholipid bilayer or monolayer. The FSB's independence is enabled by the continuous water layer (greater than 15 \u00c5) that remains between the two. However, previous FSBs have had limited stability and low density. Here, we demonstrate by surface plasmon resonance and neutron reflectivity, the formation of a complete self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on gold surfaces by a synthetic phosphatidylcholine bearing a thiol group at the end of one fatty acyl chain. Furthermore, a very dense FSB (more than 96%) of saturated phosphatidylcholine can be formed on this SAM by sequential Langmuir\u2013Blodgett and Langmuir\u2013Schaefer procedures. Neutron reflectivity used both isotopic and magnetic contrast to enhance the accuracy of the data fits. This system offers the means to study transmembrane proteins, membrane potential effects (using the gold as an electrode) and even model bacterial outer membranes. Using unsaturated phosphatidylcholines, which have previously failed to form stable FSBs, we achieved a coverage of 73%.",

    "abstract": "First-principles density-functional theory calculations reveal significantly different behavior between group-IIIA and IIIB delafossites $\\text{Cu}M{\\text{O}}_{2}$. The group-IIIA delafossites have indirect band gaps with large differences between the direct and indirect band gaps. However, this difference is small for the group-IIIB delafossites: only 0.22 eV for ${\\text{CuScO}}_{2}$ and it diminishes further for ${\\text{CuYO}}_{2}$ and ${\\text{CuLaO}}_{2}$. Also, whereas group IIIA prefers rhombohedral stacking, group IIIB stabilizes in hexagonal structures. We further find that ${\\text{CuScO}}_{2}$ has the highest calculated fundamental band gap among all the delafossite oxides. In addition, ${\\text{CuLaO}}_{2}$ is found to have a direct band gap. These differences are explained by the different atomic configurations between the group-IIIA and IIIB elements. Our understanding of these delafossites provides general guidance for proper selection of delafossites for suitable applications in optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": " Floating supported bilayers (FSBs) are new systems which have emerged over the past few years to produce supported membrane mimics, where the bilayers remain associated with the substrate, but are cushioned from the substrates constraining influence by a large hydration layer. In this paper we describe a new approach to fabricating FSBs using a chemically grafted phospholipid layer as the support for the floating membrane. The grafted lipid layer was produced using a Langmuir\u2212Schaeffer transfer of acryloyl-functionalized lipid onto a pre-prepared substrate, with AIBN-induced cross-polymerization to permanently bind the lipids in place. A bilayer of DSPC was then deposited onto this grafted monolayer using a combination of Langmuir\u2212Blodgett and Langmuir\u2212Schaeffer transfer. The resulting system was characterized by neutron reflection under two water contrasts, and we show that the new system shows a hydrating layer of \u223c17.5 \u00c5 in the gel phase, which is comparable to previously described FSB systems. We provide evidence that the grafted substrate is reusable after cleaning and suggest that this greatly simplifies the fabrication and characterization of FSBs compared to previous methods.  ",

    "abstract": "A new synthetic route to functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) via supramolecular interactions using a specifically designed naphthalenediimide (NDI) nanoreceptor is demonstrated. The tendency of the NDI to spontaneously form composites with carbon nanomaterials leads to fluorescent amino acid tagged SWNTs, which are dispersible in widely accessible organic solvents (CHCl3, DMSO) as well as in biocompatible cell medium (EMEM, Eagle's modified essential medium). The X-ray crystal structure of the first iodine-tagged and amino acid-functionalized NDI molecule, designed especially to facilitate the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR TEM) imaging whilst retaining its ability to self-assemble into a nanodimensional receptor in weakly polar solvents, is also described. A new hybrid material, NDI@SWNT, was prepared and characterized as dispersed in organic solvents and aqueous media and in the solid state by HR TEM, tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), circular dichroism, Raman and fluorescence spectroscopies (steady-state single and two-photon techniques). Combined microscopy techniques, density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms (SIESTA) program and spectroscopic measurements in solution indicate that amino acid-functionalized NDI interacts strongly with SWNTs and forms a donor-acceptor complex. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted the geometry and the binding energies of an NDI molecule loaded onto a SWNT strand and the possibility of charge transfer interactions within the hybrid. The NDI@SWNT composite translocates into cells (e.g. FEK-4, HeLa, MCF-7) as an intact object and localizes in the cells' cytoplasm and partially in the nucleus. The NDI coating enhances the biocompatibility of SWNTs and mediates its intracellular localization as shown by confocal fluorescence imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) techniques. The excited state fluorescence lifetime of the probes in cells versus solution phase indicates that the probes remain unaffected by the change in their chemical environment within the experimental timescale (2 h).",

The as-formed glyco-AuNPs can be used for the selective detection of sugar\u2013lectin interactions, which are vital to many important physiological and pathological processes. The approach uses AuNPs as bioprobes since they produce, sensitively, changes in both color visible to the naked eye and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), on aggregation. Strain-promoted click reaction of an azido galactoside with a lipid cyclooctyne affords a galactolipid that can be embedded into polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated AuNP via self-assembly. Subsequently, using naked-eye and plasmon resonance scattering spectroscopy, we were able to observe the colorimetric and plasmonic variations of the glyco-AuNPs, respectively, in the presence of a selective lectin over other proteins.Keywords:  sugar; lectin; Au-NP; click chemistry; SPAAC; plasmon resonance scattering spectroscopy",

    "abstract": " Solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using the organic hole-transporting medium (HTM) 2,2\u20187,7\u2018-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9\u2018-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), and three organic indoline-based sensitizer dyes with high molar extinction coefficients. The cells were characterized by several techniques, including spectral response measurements, photovoltage decay transients, intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and charge extraction. The differences in apparent electron lifetime observed for cells fabricated using the three dyes are attributed in part to changes in the surface dipole potential at the TiO2/spiro-MeOTAD interface, which shift the TiO2 conduction band energy relative to the Fermi level of the HTM. These energy shifts influence both the open circuit voltage (as a result of changes in free electron density) and the short circuit current (as a consequence of changes in the overlap between the dye LUMO level and the conduction band). A self-consistent approach was used to derive the positions of the conduction band relative to the spiro-MeOTAD redox Fermi level for cells fabricated using the three dyes. The analysis also provided estimates of the free electron lifetime in spiro-MeOTAD cells. In order to evaluate the possible contribution of the adsorbed dyes to the observed changes in surface dipole potential, their dipole moments were estimated using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Comparison of the calculated dipole contributions with the experimentally measured shifts in conduction band energy revealed that other factors such as proton adsorption may be predominant in determining the surface dipole potential.

    "abstract": "Electrochemical processes in highly viscous media such as poly(ethylene glycol) (herein PEG200) are interesting for energy-conversion applications, but problematic due to slow diffusion causing low current densities. Here, a hydrodynamic microgap experiment based on Couette flow is introduced for an inlaid disc electrode approaching a rotating drum. Steady-state voltammetric currents are independent of viscosity and readily increased by two orders of magnitude with further potential to go to higher rotation rates and nanogaps. A quantitative theory is derived for the prediction of currents under high-shear Couette flow conditions and generalised for different electrode shapes. The 1,1\u2032-ferrocene dimethanol redox probe in PEG200 (D=1.4\u00d710\u221211 m2\u2009s\u22121) is employed and data are compared with 1) a Levich-type equation expressing the diffusion\u2013convection-limited current and 2) a COMSOL simulation model providing a potential-dependent current trace.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe electrochemically reducing nature of the poly-(ethylene-glycol) solvent (PEG200) is exploited in a one-step electroless deposition of nano-fibrous platinum electrocatalyst. K2PtCl6 is dissolved in poly-(ethylene-glycol) and applied to a substrate (here tin-doped indium oxide, ITO). The deposition process is conducted by rapid heating in a furnace in air. Upon ramping the temperature up (with 10\u00a0\u00b0C per minute to 500\u00a0\u00b0C) a complex sequence of nucleation and growth reactions leads via (i) formation of nano-fibrous platinum and (ii) complete removal of all organic components directly to an electrochemically highly active platinum deposit. When characterised in aqueous 0.5\u00a0M H2SO4, typical poly-crystal Pt surface oxidation and hydrogen adsorption features were observed. Electrocatalysis is demonstrated for methanol oxidation, for which the rate of catalysis per electrochemically active area is increased compared to that for a conventional polycrystalline platinum macro-disc",

The goal of this study was to improve the comparability and reproducibility of CID product ion mass spectra produced in different laboratories and using different instruments. This was carried out experimentally by defining a spectral calibration point on each mass spectrometer for product ion formation. The long-term goal is the development of a universal (instrument independent) product ion mass spectral library for the identification of unknowns.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to enhance our understanding of how reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated ex situ by ionized gas (plasma), can affect the regulation of signalling processes within cells. A model system, comprising of a suspension of phospholipid vesicles (cell mimics) encapsulating a ROS reporter, was developed to study the plasma delivery of ROS into cells. For the first time it was shown that plasma unequivocally delivers ROS into cells over a sustained period and without compromising cell membrane integrity. An important consideration in cell and biological assays is the presence of serum, which significantly reduced the transfer efficiency of ROS into the vesicles. These results are key to understanding how plasma treatments can be tailored for specific medical or biotechnology applications. Further, the phospholipid vesicle ROS reporter system may find use in other studies involving the application of free radicals in biology and medicine.",

PFG-NMR and relaxometry have revealed that the spatial disposition of frozen and molten phases, at a particular point in a loop, depends upon the prior thermal history, as expected from previous work. However, these data have also shown the vital importance of incorporating the advanced melting process in order to adequately interpret cryoporometry data, and thence the ability to distinguish between interpretations arising from structural or thermodynamic considerations. The advanced melting process has been shown to greatly impact the accuracy of pore size distributions derived from the melting curve using the conventional approach that neglects it. Further, it has been shown that the freeze/thaw hysteresis can be progressively expunged using \u2018mini-loop\u2019-type experiments. Hence, the potential reversibility of freeze/thaw processes, even in disordered materials, has been demonstrated. This lack of hysteresis is consistent with the axial freezing and melting expected when both heterogeneous nucleation of freezing, and advanced melting, occur.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAsthma is a common, chronic inflammatory airway disease of major public health importance with multiple genetic determinants. Previously, we found by positional cloning that PHD finger protein 11 (PHF11) on chromosome 13q14 modifies serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations and asthma susceptibility. No coding variants in PHF11 were identified.ObjectiveHere we investigate the 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this gene most significantly associated with total serum IgE levels\u2014rs3765526, rs9526569, and rs1046295\u2014for a role in transcription factor binding.MethodsWe used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to examine the effect of the 3 SNPs on transcription factor binding in 3 cell lines relevant to asthma pathogenesis. Relative preferential expression of alleles was investigated by using the allelotyping method.ResultsElectrophoretic mobility shift assays show that rs1046295 modulates allele-specific binding by the octamer-binding transcription factor 1 (Oct-1). Analysis of the relative expression levels of the 2 alleles of this SNP in heterozygous individuals showed a modest, but highly significant (P\u00a0= 6.5 \u00d7 10\u221216), preferential expression of the A\u00a0allele consistent with a functional role for rs1046295.ConclusionThese results suggest a mechanism by which rs1046295 may act as a regulatory variant modulating transcription at this locus and altering asthma susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAn important class of novel mesoporous and microporous adsorbents like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are normally produced in powder form. This paper presents a generic method of manufacturing and characterisation of these materials into low pressure drop and energy saving monolithic structures for industrial applications. One of the MOF candidates that was considered in this study was MIL-101 (Cr) ([Cr3O(OH)(H2O)2(bdc)3].xH2O; bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), and the model contaminant gas tested was carbon dioxide (CO2). MIL-101 (Cr) monoliths were manufactured by paste extrusion techniques from the synthesized MIL-101 (Cr) powder. These MIL-101 (Cr) monoliths were then characterised using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), radial compression tests and intelligent gravimetric analysis (IGA). Adsorption properties of the prepared MIL-101 (Cr) powder and monoliths were determined from their pure CO2 sorption isotherms and dynamic adsorption breakthrough curves, that were carried out using high concentration (40% v/v) CO2 challenge. Results have demonstrated that the resulting MIL-101 (Cr) monoliths were highly porous, mechanically strong on compressive loading, thermally regenerable with comparable CO2 adsorption capacity to the synthesized MIL-101 (Cr) powder. From breakthrough curves, mass transfer characteristics such as mass transfer zone velocity and length of the prepared MIL-101 (Cr) monoliths have also been evaluated in this study.",

    "abstract": "We present evidence for Cp* being a sacrificial placeholder ligand in the [Cp*IrIII(chelate)X] series of homogeneous oxidation catalysts. UV\u2013vis and 1H NMR profiles as well as MALDI-MS data show a rapid and irreversible loss of the Cp* ligand under reaction conditions, which likely proceeds through an intramolecular inner-sphere oxidation pathway reminiscent of the reductive in situ elimination of diolefin placeholder ligands in hydrogenation catalysis by [(diene)MI(L,L\u2032)]+ (M = Rh and Ir) precursors. When oxidatively stable chelate ligands are bound to the iridium in addition to the Cp*, the oxidized precursors yield homogeneous solutions with a characteristic blue color that remain active in both water- and CH-oxidation catalysis without further induction period. Electrophoresis suggests the presence of well-defined Ir-cations, and TEM-EDX, XPS, 17O NMR, and resonance-Raman spectroscopy data are most consistent with the molecular identity of the blue species to be a bis-\u03bc-oxo di-iridium(IV) coordination compound with two waters and one chelate ligand bound to each metal. DFT calculations give insight into the electronic structure of this catalyst resting state, and time-dependent simulations agree with the assignments of the experimental spectroscopic data. [(cod)IrI(chelate)] precursors bearing the same chelate ligands are shown to be equally effective precatalysts for both water- and CH-oxidations using NaIO4 as chemical oxidant.",

    "abstract": "From high-resolution (65 \u03bcm) data acquired by magnetic resonance imaging, we have reconstructed the nasal passageway of a single adult hagfish specimen (probably Eptatretus stoutii). We have used this reconstruction to investigate how the anatomy and morphometry of the nasal passageway influence the olfactory ability of the hagfish. We found that the long, broad section of the passageway preceding the nasal chamber will delay the response to an odor by 1\u20132 s. Diffusion of odorant to the olfactory epithelium, on which the olfactory sensitivity of an animal depends, will be favored by the relatively large surface area of the olfactory epithelium (\u223c140 mm2) and a modest expansion in the nasal chamber. Oscillating flow (0.3\u20130.4 Hz) within the narrow (65\u2013130 \u03bcm) sensory channels of the nasal chamber is laminar (Reynolds number \u223c 5) and quasi-steady (Womersley number generally less than one). Distribution of flow over the olfactory epithelium may be aided by: (a) a narrowing before the nasal chamber; (b) partial blockage of the nasal passageway by a protrusion on the central olfactory lamella; and (c) the inward inclination of the olfactory lamellae.

    "abstract": "The conversion of gas adsorption isotherms into pore size distributions generally relies upon the assumption of thermodynamically independent pores. Hence, pore\u2212pore cooperative adsorption effects, which might result in a significantly skewed pore size distribution, are neglected. In this work, cooperative adsorption effects in water adsorption on a real, amorphous, mesoporous silica material have been studied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pulsed-gradient stimulated-echo (PGSE) NMR techniques. Evidence for advanced adsorption can be seen directly using relaxation time weighted MRI. The number and spatial distributions of pixels containing pores of different sizes filled with condensate have been analyzed. The spatial distribution of filled pores has been found to be highly nonrandom. Pixels containing the largest pores present in the material have been observed to fill in conjunction with pixels containing much smaller pores. PGSE NMR has confirmed the spatially extensive nature of the adsorbed ganglia. Thus, long-range (\u226540 \u03bcm) cooperative adsorption effects, between larger pores associated with smaller pores, occur within mesoporous materials. The NMR findings have also suggested particular types of pore filling mechanisms occur within the porous solid studied.",

Statistical experimental design was used to show that the reaction rate is neither much affected by the film thickness (IL loading) nor by the syngas:substrate ratio. However, a factor-dependent interaction between the syngas:substrate ratio and film thickness on the reaction rate was revealed. Increasing the substrate flow led to increased reaction rates but lower overall yields. One of the most important parameters proved to be the phase behaviour of the mobile phase, which was studied by varying the reaction pressure. At low CO2 pressures or when N2 was used instead of CO2 rates were low because of poor gas diffusion to the catalytic sites in the SILP. Furthermore, leaching of IL and Rh was high because the substrate is liquid and the IL had been designed to dissolve in it. As the CO2 pressure was increased, the reaction rate increased and the IL and Rh leaching were reduced, because an expanded liquid phase developed. Due to its lower viscosity the expanded liquid allows better transport of gases to the catalyst and is a poorer solvent for the IL and the catalyst because of its reduced polarity. Above 100 bar (close to the transition to a single phase at 106 bar), the rate of reaction dropped again with increasing pressure because the flowing phase becomes a better and better solvent for the alkene, reducing its partitioning into the IL film.

However, despite increasing use in specialty and fine chemical production issues of catalyst recovery still hamper broader application and prevent tapping the full potential of this technology on industrial scale. Even though scientists have tackled this problem for decades practicable methods remained scarce. In this contribution we analyse the major challenges of performing organometallic catalysis in continuous flow from a conceptual point of view, and exemplify for recently developed concepts based on near- and supercritical fluids how the integration of molecular and engineering principles can offer new solutions to this persistent problem.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The new cationic complexes bearing monodentate pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands were characterized crystallographically and by variable-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT-NMR). Control experiments and mercury poisoning tests showed that iridium(0) nanoparticles, although active in the reaction, are not responsible for the high activity observed for the most active precatalyst [Cp*Ir(IMe)2Cl]BF4 (6). For efficient catalysis, it was found necessary to have both NHCs in monodentate form; tying them together in a bis-NHC chelate ligand gave greatly reduced activity. The kinetics of the base-assisted reaction showed induction periods as well as deactivation processes, and H/D scrambling experiments cast some doubt on the classical monohydride mechanism.Keywords:  transfer hydrogenation; Cp*Ir complexes; N-heterocyclic carbenes; homogeneous catalysis; kinetics; monohydride mechanism",

    "abstract": "AbstractA direct synthetic route to cationic N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of rhodium and iridium from neat dialkyl-imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) has been found. The method uses complexes bearing basic anionic ligands, [M(COD)(PPh3)X], X\u00a0=\u00a0OEt, MeCO2, which react with the inactivated imidazolium cation in the absence of external bases yielding one M-NHC moiety and the free protonated base. This new one-pot synthesis leaving pure, catalytically active IL solutions is faster, cleaner and more efficient than traditional syntheses of such NHC complexes. The observed reactivity also gives insight into NHC incorporation of rhodium and iridium catalyzed reactions performed in common dialkyl-imidazolium ILs.The complexes synthesised in this manner are compared with their bis-phosphine analogues in terms of activity for catalytic dehydrogenation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,3-cyclooctadiene in neat [BMIM][NTf2] as solvent. Even at high temperature, no ligand exchange reaction is observed with [(COD)M(PPh3)2] [NTf2] catalysts. As expected, the yields of all the reactions were low, iridium was much more active in C\u2013H activation than rhodium and the NHC ligands were more stable than triphenylphosphine. For all catalysts, the isomerisation of 1,5-cyclooctadiene is the major reaction. However, the phosphine-NHC complex of iridium seems to be more selective for dehydrogenation than its bis-phosphine counterpart, which is more active in transfer-hydrogenation and less stable under the applied conditions. Different reaction conditions were tried in order to optimise selectivity for dehydrogenation over isomerisation and transfer-hydrogenation. Surprisingly, with 1,3-cyclooctadiene as substrate selectivity for dehydrogenation is much higher than with 1,5-cyclooctadiene for all catalysts.",

    "abstract": "A continuous-flow process based on a chiral transition-metal complex in a supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as the mobile phase is presented for asymmetric catalytic transformations of low-volatility organic substrates at mild reaction temperatures. Enantioselectivity of >99\u2009%\u2005ee and quantitative conversion were achieved in the hydrogenation of dimethylitaconate for up to 30\u2005h, reaching turnover numbers beyond 100\u2009000 for the chiral QUINAPHOS\u2013rhodium complex. By using an automated high-pressure continuous-flow setup, the product was isolated in analytically pure form without the use of any organic co-solvent and with no detectable catalyst leaching. Phase-behaviour studies and high-pressure NMR spectroscopy assisted the localisation of optimum process parameters by quantification of substrate partitioning between the IL and scCO2. Fundamental insight into the molecular interactions of the metal complex, ionic liquid and the surface of the support in working SILP catalyst materials was gained by means of systematic variations, spectroscopic studies and labelling experiments. In concert, the obtained results provided a rationale for avoiding progressive long-term deactivation. The optimised system reached stable selectivities and productivities that correspond to 0.7\u2005kg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121 space\u2013time yield and at least 100\u2005kg product per gram of rhodium, thus making such processes attractive for larger-scale application.",

While it is known that both mono-NHC Ag(I) and bis-NHC Ag(I) complexes are accessible, different reactivities of these species have not been explored synthetically. Whereas the commonly used mono-NHC Ag(I) complexes act as NHC donors only, we found that a bis-NHC Ag(I) complex was capable of transferring one carbene under halide abstraction. This is exemplified in the transformation of P\u2013Cl compounds into the respective imidazolium\u2013phosphines by a bis-NHC Ag(I) complex but not by its corresponding mono-NHC Ag(I) complex. When the bis-NHC Ag(I) complex was allowed to react with [M(cod)Cl]2 (M = Rh, Ir), both NHCs were transferred under chloride abstraction to give [M(cod)(NHC)2]+ exclusively, a reaction which is reported to stop at [M(cod)Cl(NHC)] even with an excess of mono-NHC Ag(I) complex in the presence of AgPF6.",

The reactions are applicable to the coupling of a wide variety of amine and silane substrates and are proposed to occur via a sequence of discrete Si\u2013H/M\u2013N and N\u2013H/M\u2013H metathesis steps. Whereas reactions of dialkyl group 2 species with 2,6-di-iso-propylaniline and phenylsilane delivered a series of well-defined compounds consistent with this rationale, kinetic analysis of the cross-coupling of diethylamine with diphenylsilane provided evidence for a more complex and subtly variable mechanistic landscape. Although reactions performed with all three pre-catalysts presented a number of common features, in every case the calcium species, 2, was found to provide notably superior catalytic activity, an order of magnitude higher than both 1 and 3 and in excess of many previously described benchmark transition metal- or f-element-mediated processes. Variations in overall reaction order, mode of pre-catalyst activation and the nature of the rate determining process are postulated to arise as a consequence of the marked change in M2+ radius and resultant charge density as group 2 is descended.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Although these systems were found to be prone to the separation of oily, most likely liquid clathrate, materials, either slow cooling or careful diffusion of the less polar solvent hexane into toluene solutions yielded nine crystalline heterobimetallic complexes in which the coordination sphere of the cationic group 1 center was found by X-ray diffraction analysis to be provided by two IPr ligands. These derivatives are the first examples of any compounds in which coordination at the central alkali metal cation is provided exclusively by NHC ligands and, for the cases where M = Na, are the first instances of any type in which an NHC ligand is bound to sodium. The anionic group 2-containing component of each compound was found to comprise three bis(trimethylsilyl)amido ligands coordinated in an approximately trigonal array about the divalent metal center. The bonding within the unusual cationic components of the compounds has been investigated by density functional theoretical (DFT) methods. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses have revealed that the coordination is provided by donation of the sp-hydridized IPr lone pair into the valence s-orbital of the alkali metal cation and are consistent with weaker binding, and consequently more labile solution behavior, as group 1 is descended.",

    "abstract": "Interest in poly(diorgano)silanes, catenated silicon compounds and heavier element analogues of alkanes has derived largely from their 1-dimensional delocalisation across the Si\u2013Si \u03c3 framework, which affords similar properties observed for polyene and unsaturated \u201call organic\u201d polymers. Although not so widely recognised or studied, similar \u201c\u03c3-delocalised\u201d activity may also be observed for homocatenated species of other p-block elements. In this study, a foundation for an understanding of the phenomenon of \u03c3-delocalisation is provided through consideration of the structures, methods of synthesis and electronic behaviour of the well-established poly(diorgano)silanes. Synthetic and theoretical developments relating to analogous derivatives based upon silicon\u2019s heavier group 14 congeners are then reviewed along with the more limited examples of catenated compounds among the heavier elements of groups 15 and 13. This coverage does not dwell upon detailed aspects of structure or electronic behaviour for the individual compounds and classes of compound included. Rather, the intention is to promote something of a phenomenological awareness of a series of superficially disparate chemical systems and to encourage a more widespread appreciation of the implication that, in not displaying \u03c3-delocalisation, it is the elements of the first full period that display the more unusual or anomalous behaviour.",

A mononuclear constitution is enforced through the incorporation of bi- and tridentate N-donor ligands. The resultant 4- or 6-coordinate complexes have been identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and have been assessed for their potential as molecular precursors to hybrid cobalt/silicon oxide thin film materials by thermogravimetric analysis. A TMEDA adduct of the bis-ligated Co(II) tris(tert-butoxy)siloxide species has been utilized as a single-source precursor for the AACVD of aesthetically attractive blue composite films. Analysis by PXRD, SEM, EDS and XPS indicated the production of amorphous, continuous films with the bulk compositions reflecting the cobalt, silicon and oxygen stoichiometry of the molecular precursor complex.",

A modular, building block approach to the synthesis employs a range of linked aryl aldehydes and cyclic ketones. Consequently, the structures of DEMs can be tuned with regard to size and shape and the incorporation of functional elements for specific purposes.

This reaction is proposed to occur through the formation of an unobserved N-heterocycle-coordinated magnesium hydride and subsequent hydride transfer via the C2-position of the heterocycle prior to hydride transfer to the C4-position and formation of thermodynamically-favoured magnesium 1,4-dihydropyridides. This reaction is kinetically suppressed for 2,6-dimethylpyridine while the kinetic product, the 1,2-dihydropyridide derivative, was isolated through reaction with 4-methylpyridine (4-methylpyridine), in which case the formation of the 1,4-dihyropyridide is prevented by the presence of the 4-methyl substituent. X-ray structures of the products of these reactions with 4-methylpyridine, 3,5-dimethylpyridine and iso-quinoline comprise a pseudo-tetrahedral magnesium centre while the regiochemistry of the particular dearomatisation reaction is determined by the substitution pattern of the N-heterocycle under observation. The compounds are all air-sensitive and exposure of the magnesium derivatives of dearomatised pyridine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to air resulted in ligand rearomatisation and the formation of dimeric \u03bc2-\u03b72-\u03b72-peroxomagnesium compounds which have also been subject to analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. An unsuccessful extension of this chemistry to N-heterocycle hydrosilylation is suggested to be a consequence of the low basicity of the silane reagent in comparison to the pyridine substrates which effectively impedes any further interaction with the magnesium centres.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The effect of varying the acid groups on cell fabrication, electrical performance and stability has been studied. The photophysical and electrochemical properties have been recorded and are relatively similar across the dye series, all showing parameters consistent with successful cell function, suggesting these dyes can be used as a good model to investigate the effect of changing the acid binding groups. Device measurements showed that the dyes containing a 4,4\u2032-dicarboxy-bipyridine ligand, with two CO2H groups on the same bipy, gave higher short-circuit current than the dyes that had ligands with no more than one carboxylate group on a given bipy. Measurement of dye uptake on TiO2 using optical waveguide spectroscopy suggested that the dye with three acid groups provided better dye coverage, faster dye uptake rate, and a greater amount of dye remaining in the cell after rinsing. All four dyes gave cells that were broadly thermally stable at 85 \u00b0C over 500 hours, however the dye with only one acid group showed poorer thermal stability than the others.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " Neutron powder diffraction studies of 154Sm58NiO3, 154Sm60NiO3, and 154Sm62NiO3, at a range of temperatures through the M\u2212I transition at approximately 128 \u00b0C, have been performed on the new general materials diffractometer (GEM) at ISIS, RAL. With combined data-set Rietveld analysis, using samples containing different nickel isotopes with contrasting scattering lengths, it has been found that extremely high quality structural parameters can be determined, even though total data collection times are more than an order of magnitude shorter than those previously used for this system. Rietveld analysis shows that the evolution of the structural parameters over the temperature range are smooth and that no symmetry change or abrupt structural transition occurs at the M\u2212I transition. This is consistent with evolution of the high-temperature metallic material within the low-temperature insulating phase over the temperature range 108\u2212128 \u00b0C. The key effects of thermal motion on the M\u2212I transition have been extracted from the data and are discussed.  ",

The rationale behind improvements in the precision and accuracy of the refined model as a result of reduction in parameter correlation in the least-squares technique is described. The improvements are demonstrated practically through a study of isotopically copper-substituted tenorite, CuO, at 2 and 300\u00a0K. Typically, the estimated errors on structural parameters from the combined analysis technique are 30% lower than separate single-data-set analyses. Comparison of the precision and accuracy of the structural models obtained from this investigation with previous single-crystal X-ray studies are also presented.",

Constant wavelength powder neutron diffraction data collected on isotopically substituted titanium silicalite (TS-1) samples, with a Si:Ti molar ratio of 39:1, have been studied using a combination of single and multiple data set Rietveld analysis exploiting the scattering length contrast between the different titanium isotopes and silicon. This has allowed both the silicon vacancy and titanium site substitution distributions to be determined, which has not been possible previously. Both distributions are found to be nonrandom with the titanium preferentially substituting on 3 of the 12 crystallographically independent framework sitesT8, T10 and T3 (in order of decreasing titanium content)and silicon vacancies on 2 framework sitesT1 and T5. This study illustrates the power of isotopic substitution in powder neutron diffraction experiments to yield enhanced structural information in complex systems.  ",

One motivation is the direct and selective uptake of pollutant/hazardous gases, where the material produces a measurable response in the presence of the analyte. In this report, we present a combined experimental and theoretical rationalization for the piezochromic response of a robust and porous molecular crystal built from an extensively fluorinated trispyrazole. The electronic response of the material is directly determined by analyte uptake, which provokes a subtle lattice contraction and an observable bathochromic shift in the optical absorption onset. Selectivity for fluorinated absorbates is demonstrated, and toluene is also found to crystallize within the pore. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of electronic structure calculations to predict a physicochemical response, providing the foundations for the design of electronically tunable porous solids with the chemical properties required for development of novel gas-uptake media.Keywords:  Piezochromism; molecular crystal; density functional theory; bathochromism",

The unit cell undergoes phase changes that are determined by diffraction methods to occur between \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-polymorphs at around 400, 550 and 900 \u00b0C. The \u03b4-Bi2Hf2O7 polymorph corresponds to the ideal cubic pyrochlore phase. Three of the four polymorphs have previously been reported to occur for Bi2Sn2O7. The need to accommodate the active Bi3+ lone pair in the presence of large HfO6 octahedra results in an \u201cicelike\u201d ordering of Bi positions in Bi2Hf2O7 at room temperature. A similar sequence of phase transitions is observed at room temperature with increasing Ti4+ for Hf4+ substitution in the compositional series Bi2Hf2-xTixO7. The structure changes as the space available to the Bi3+ ion increases represent a gradual increase in disorder and symmetry.  ",

The HKUST-1 framework demonstrates exceptional gas storage, sensing and separation, catalytic activity and, in recent studies, unprecedented ionic and electrical conductivity. These results are a promising step towards the real-world application of metal\u2013organic materials. In this perspective, we discuss progress in the understanding of the electronic, magnetic and physical properties of HKUST-1, representative of the larger family of Cu\u22efCu containing metal\u2013organic frameworks.

Self-assembling organic\u2013inorganic compounds offer immense potential for functionalising material properties for a wide scope of applications including solar cells, light emitters, gas sensors and bipolar transparent conductors. The flexibility of combining two distinct material classes into a single solid-state system provides an almost infinite number of chemical and structural possibilities; however, there is currently no systematic approach established for designing new compositions and configurations with targeted electronic or optical properties. We review the current status in the field, in particular, the range of hybrid systems reported to date and the important role of materials modelling in the field. From theoretical arguments, the Mott insulator-to-metal transition should be possible in semiconducting metal\u2013organic frameworks, but has yet to be observed. The question remains as to whether electro-active hybrid materials will evolve from chemical curiosities towards practical applications in the near term.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Through a combination of synthesis and computation, we elucidated the electronic structure of MIL-125 with aminated linkers. The band gap decrease observed when the monoaminated bdc-NH2 linker was used arises from donation of the N 2p electrons to the aromatic linking unit, resulting in a red-shifted band above the valence-band edge of MIL-125. We further explored in silico MIL-125 with the diaminated linker bdc-(NH2)2 and other functional groups (\u2212OH, \u2212CH3, \u2212Cl) as alternative substitutions to control the optical response. The bdc-(NH2)2 linking unit was predicted to lower the band gap of MIL-125 to 1.28 eV, and this was confirmed through the targeted synthesis of the bdc-(NH2)2-based MIL-125. This study illustrates the possibility of tuning the optical response of MOFs through rational functionalization of the linking unit, and the strength of combined synthetic/computational approaches for targeting functionalized hybrid materials.",

Whilst the textbook molecular orbital description explains the general electronic and molecular structure of the cumulenes, there are anomalies in both the crystal structures and cycloaddition products involving oligoynes and allenes; the understanding of these molecules is incomplete. Through a computational study we elucidate that the frontier orbitals of the allene and oligoyne families are extended helices. These orbitals are the linear analogue to the M\u00f6bius aromatic systems, which also display non-linear \u03c0 interactions. The axial chirality found in allenes and oligoynes is intimately related to the topology of the frontier orbitals, and has implications for predictions of cycloaddition pathways, structure stability and spectroscopy.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The dissolution and extraction of these organic molecules is a process dependent on the dissolved mineral content of the water. It is known that different rates and compositions of coffee extraction are achieved through the control of the water \u201cimpurities\u201d, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, which coordinate to nucleophilic motifs in coffee. Using density functional theory, we quantify the thermodynamic binding energies of five familiar coffee-contained acids, caffeine, and a representative flavor component, eugenol. From this, we provide insight into the mechanism and ideal mineral composition of water for extraction of flavorsome compounds in coffee.Keywords:  coffee extraction; water impurities; density functional theory",

    "abstract": " Steroid sulfatases regulate the formation of estrogenic steroids which can support the growth of endocrine-dependent breast tumors. Therefore, the development of potent steroid sulfatase inhibitors could have considerable therapeutic potential. Several such inhibitors have now been developed including estrone 3-O-sulfamate (EMATE, 1), which shows potent active site-directed inhibition. However, EMATE was subsequently shown to be also a potent estrogen. In an attempt to reduce the estrogenicity while retaining the potent sulfatase inhibitory properties associated with this type of molecule, (E)-17-oximino-3-O-sulfamoyl-1,3,5(10)-estratriene (5) (estrone oxime 3-O-sulfamate, OMATE) was synthesized. The X-ray crystal structure of (E)-17-oximino-3-hydroxy-1,3,5(10)-estratriene (4) (estrone oxime) demonstrated the presence of only one geometrical isomer [anti-isomer, (E)]. OMATE potently inhibited estrone sulfatase (E1-STS) activity and was similar to EMATE (>99% inhibition at 0.1 \u03bcM in MCF-7 breast cancer cells). It was also evaluated in vivo for its estrogenicity and ability to inhibit sulfatase activity. While it was equipotent with EMATE in vivo as a sulfatase inhibitor, it surprisingly had a stimulatory effect on uterine growth in ovariectomized rats about 1.5-fold greater than that of EMATE. Thus, OMATE possesses potential as a superestrogen and modification at C-17 is identified as a useful route for enhancement of estrogenicity in sulfamate-based estrogens.  ",

Conversion of these oxide arrays to oxide\u2013nitride arrays was carried out by reaction of the deposited SrZr1\u2212xTaxO3 materials under high purity flowing ammonia.

We identified 13 new loci in or near RSPO3, VEGFA, TBX15-WARS2, NFE2L3, GRB14, DNM3-PIGC, ITPR2-SSPN, LY86, HOXC13, ADAMTS9, ZNRF3-KREMEN1, NISCH-STAB1 and CPEB4 (P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22129 to P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221240) and the known signal at LYPLAL1. Seven of these loci exhibited marked sexual dimorphism, all with a stronger effect on WHR in women than men (P for sex difference = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 to P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221213).

The S-rGO was fabricated by a lyophilization-assisted method from a liquid mixture of GO and (NH4)2SO4 with a subsequent thermal treatment in inert gas. Sulfonic acid groups were grafted on GO and a reduction of GO was achieved simultaneously. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) results showed a uniform deposition of Pt NPs on S-rGO (Pt/S-rGO) with a narrow particle size distribution ranging from 2 to 5\u00a0nm in diameter. A higher catalytic activity of this novel Pt/S-rGO catalyst was revealed in comparison with that of Pt/GO, Pt/rGO and conventional Pt/C catalysts by cyclic voltammetry and oxygen reduction reaction measurements due to an enhanced triphase boundary. Significantly, the Pt/S-rGO catalyst also presented an excellent electrochemical stability. This new catalyst thus holds a great potential application in PEMFCs in terms of enhanced activity and durability.",

We measure the induced orientational anisotropy function, R(t), using time-correlated single photon counting. Our data show that both chromophores exhibit single exponential anisotropy decays in aqueous solution and two-component exponential anisotropy decays in NOP. The change of the anisotropy decay functionality indicates that the effective rotor shape swept out by solute rotational motion is different in the two solvents. We interpret these findings in the context of Chuang and Eisenthal\u2019s theory of fluorescence depolarization by rotational diffusion. The similarity in the behavior of the two different chromophores in these solvent systems points to solvent\u2212solvent interactions and local organization as the dominant factors in mediating motional dynamics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to the increased prevalence of resistant bacterial isolates which are no longer susceptible to antibiotic treatment, recent emphasis has been placed on finding alternative modes of treatment of wound infections. Bacteriophage have long been investigated for their antimicrobial properties, yet the utilization of phage therapy for the treatment of wound infections relies on a suitable delivery system. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a thermally responsive polymer which undergoes a temperature dependent phase transition at a critical solution temperature. Bacteriophage K has been successfully formulated with PNIPAM nanospheres copolymerized with allylamine (PNIPAM-co-ALA). By utilizing a temperature responsive polymer it has been possible to engineer the nanospheres to collapse at an elevated temperature associated with a bacterial skin infection. The nanogels were reacted with surface deposited maleic anhydride in order to anchor the nanogels to non-woven fabric. Bacteriophage incorporated PNIPAM-co-ALA nanospheres demonstrated successful bacterial lysis of a clinically relevant bacterial isolate \u2013 Staphylococcus aureus ST228 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, whilst bacterial growth was unaffected at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, thus providing a thermally triggered release of bacteriophage.",

Our data show that resorufin exhibits a single exponential anisotropy decay in aqueous solutions containing up to 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4). In contrast to the observed behavior of resorufin in pure NOP, where biexponential decay occurs, we also observe a single exponential anisotropy decay for resorufin in NOP with the addition of up to 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) or tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB). For resorufin in NOP, the reorientation time constant increases with increasing electrolyte concentration, consistent with complexation between the resorufin anion and the electrolyte ammonium cation. We observe a qualitatively different trend in the aqueous resorufin solutions and understand these data for both solvent systems in the context of interactions between the chromophore and cationic species present.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA thermostable adenylate kinase (tAK) has been used as model protein contaminant on surfaces, so used because residual protein after high temperature wash steps can be detected at extremely low concentrations. This gives the potential for accurate, quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of different wash processes in removing protein contamination. Current methods utilise non-covalent (physisorbtion) of tAK to surfaces, but this can be relatively easily removed. In this study, the covalent binding of tAK to surfaces was studied to provide an alternative model for surface contamination. Kinetic analysis showed that the efficiency of the enzyme expressed as the catalytic rate over the Michaelis constant (kcat/KM) increased from 8.45\u00b13.04\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 in solution to 32.23\u00b13.20 or 24.46\u00b14.41\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 when the enzyme was immobilised onto polypropylene or plasma activated polypropylene respectively. Maleic anhydride plasma activated polypropylene showed potential to provide a more robust challenge for washing processes as it retained significantly higher amounts of tAK enzyme than polypropylene in simple washing experiments. Inhibition of the coupled enzyme (luciferase/luciferin) system used for the detection of adenylate kinase activity, was observed for a secondary product of the reaction. This needs to be taken into consideration when using the assay to estimate cleaning efficacy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDetermining the folding core of a protein yields information about its folding process and dynamics. The experimental procedures for identifying the amino acids that make up the folding core include hydrogen-deuterium exchange and \u00ce\u00a6-value analysis and can be expensive and time consuming. Because of this, there is a desire to improve upon existing methods for determining protein folding cores theoretically. We have obtained HDX data for the complex of cyclophilin A with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. We compare these data, as well as literature values for uncomplexed cyclophilin A, to theoretical predictions using a combination of rigidity analysis and coarse-grained simulations of protein motion. We find that in this case, the most specific prediction of folding cores comes from a combined approach that models the rigidity of the protein using the first software suite and the dynamics of the protein using the froda tool.",

    "abstract": "We report on the rotational diffusion dynamics and fluorescence lifetime of lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride (LRSC) in two thin-film experimental configurations. These are liquid|solid interfaces, where N-octyl-2-pyrrolidone (NOP) containing water and ethylene glycol (EG) thin films are each supported on glass, and a liquid|liquid|solid interface where thin films of water and NOP, both supported on glass, are in contact with one another, forming an NOP|water interface. The reorientation dynamics and fluorescence lifetime of LRSC are measured as a function of distance from the NOP|glass and EG|glass interfaces and from the NOP|water and NOP|glass interfaces in the liquid|liquid|solid experimental configuration. Fluorescence anisotropy decay data from the liquid|solid systems reveal a liquid film depth-dependent gradient spanning tens of micrometers from the NOP|glass interface into the wet NOP phase, while this gradient is absent in EG. We interpret these findings in the context of a compositional gradient in the NOP phase. The spatially resolved fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decay data for an NOP|water|glass interfacial structure exhibits the absence of a gradient in the anisotropy decay profile normal to the NOP|water interface and the presence of a fluorescence lifetime gradient as a function of distance from the NOP|water interface. The compositional heterogeneity for both interfacial systems is in the form of water nanodroplets in the NOP phase. We understand this compositional gradient in the context of the relative surface energies of the water, NOP, and glass components.",

At 298 K the molecule (A) sitting in a general crystallographic site displays a mixture of isomers, 78% of the \u03b71-NO2 isomer and 22% of an endo-nitrito\u2013(\u03b71-ONO) form. The molecule (B) sitting on a crystallographic mirror plane adopts the \u03b71-NO2 isomeric form exclusively. However, a variable temperature crystallographic study showed that the two isomers were in equilibrium and upon cooling to 150 K the \u03b71-ONO isomer converted completely to the \u03b71-NO2 isomer, so that both independent molecules in the asymmetric unit were 100% in the \u03b71-NO2 form. A kinetic analysis of the equilibrium afforded values of \u0394H = \u22129.6 (\u00b10.4) kJ mol\u22121, \u0394S = \u221221.5 (\u00b11.8) J K\u22121 mol\u22121 and EA = \u22121.6 (\u00b10.05) kJ mol\u22121. Photoirradiation of single crystals of 1 with 400 nm light, at 100 K, resulted in partial isomerisation of the \u03b71-NO2 isomer to the metastable \u03b71-ONO isomer, with 89% for molecule (A), and 32% for molecule (B). The crystallographic space group also reduced in symmetry to P21 with Z\u2032 = 3. The metastable state existed up to a temperature of 150 K above which temperature it reverted to the ground state. An analysis of the crystal packing in the ground and metastable states suggests that hydrogen bonding is responsible for the difference in the conversion between molecules (A) and (B).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe methods that have been developed to determine the three-dimensional crystal and molecular structures while they are in metastable or short-lived photoactivated states are described. The structural science of photocrystallography has developed over the last two decades because of the use of synchrotron radiation, coupled with advances in cryogenics, computer hardware and software, and laser technology. Initial studies have been carried out on metastable linkage isomers and LIESST-generated metastable structures and, more recently, by using the synchronisation of laser pulses with X-ray pulses, it has been possible to determine the structures of complexes with microsecond lifetimes. In the future X-ray Laue techniques and one-shot XFEL studies applied to molecular systems promise to make the study of sub-microsecond species a reality.",

Kinetic studies show the system is no longer metastable above 150\u2005K, decaying back to the ground state nitro-(\u03b71-NO2) arrangement over several hours at 150\u2005K. Variable-temperature kinetic measurements in the range of 150\u2013160\u2005K show that the rate of endo-nitrito decay is highly dependent on temperature, and an activation energy of Eact=+48.6(4)\u2005kJ\u2009mol\u22121 is calculated for the decay process. Pseudo-steady-state experiments, where the crystal is continually pumped by the light source for the duration of the X-ray experiment, show the production of a previously unobserved, exo-nitrito-(\u03b71-ONO) linkage isomer only at temperatures close to the metastable limit (ca. 140\u2013190\u2005K).

A generator\u2013collector trench electrode system prepared from two tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrodes placed vis-\u00e0-vis with a 22 \u03bcm inter-electrode gap is employed here as a sensor in aqueous media. The reversible 2-electron anthraquinone-2-sulfonate redox system is demonstrated to give well-defined collector responses even in the presence of oxygen due to the irreversible nature of the oxygen reduction. For the oxidation of dopamine on ITO, novel \u201cPiranha-activation\u201d effects are observed and chemically reversible generator\u2013collector feedback conditions are achieved at pH 7, by selecting a more negative collector potential, again eliminating possible oxygen interference. Finally, dopamine oxidation in the presence of ascorbate is demonstrated with the irreversible oxidation of ascorbate at the \u201cmouth\u201d of the trench electrode and chemically reversible oxidation of dopamine in the trench \u201cinterior\u201d. This spatial separation of chemically reversible and irreversible processes within and outside the trench is discussed as a potential in situ microscale sensing and separation tool.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Transition-metal complexes that have been investigated using this methodology include complexes that contain nitrosyl, di\u00adnitro\u00adgen, sulfur dioxide and nitrite ligands, all of which form new linkage isomers in the solid state when photoactivated by light of the appropriate wavelength. Both steric and electronic factors determine the level of the conversion from the ground-state structure to the metastable isomeric structure, and both the `reaction cavity' size and the nature of the inter\u00admolecular inter\u00adactions are shown to be among the key factors that influence the percentage conversion.",

    "abstract": " Different crystal structures have been proposed as a basis for titanium oxide nanotubes. We have used atomistic simulation techniques to calculate the relative stability of nanotubes with these different crystal structures. Our approach is to use energy minimization, where the total interaction energy is calculated with interatomic potentials based on the Born model of solids. The results reveal nanotubes with the trititanate structure to be the most stable (at unit activity for water). Indeed, nanotubes with the trititanate structure were found to be thermodynamically more favorable than bulk trititanate for nanotube diameters greater than \u223c8 nm. However, the formation of cross-linking bonds between layers of the trititanate structure occurred frequently; this problem was eliminated by replacing two out of three Ti4+ ions with Ti3+ ions, although this resulted in a higher energy. Of the structures that do not contain hydrogen, chiral nanotubes made from (101) sheets of anatase are the lowest in energy, suggesting that this is the most likely structure for nanotubes synthesized at low water chemical potential. In general, the stability of the nanotubes increased as the nanotube diameter increased.Keywords:  energy minimization; titanium oxide; nanotubes; trititanate",

    "abstract": "The accepted picture of the structure of a micelle in solution arises from the idea that the surfactant molecules self-assemble into a spherical aggregate, driven by the conflicting affinity of their head and tail groups with the solvent. It is also assumed that the micelle\u2019s size and shape can be explained by simple arguments involving volumetric packing parameters and electrostatic interactions. By using wide Q-range neutron diffraction measurements of H/D isotopically substituted solutions of decyltrimethylammonimum bromide (C10TAB) surfactants, we are able to determine the complete, atomistic structure of a micelle and its surroundings in solution. The properties of the micelle we extract are in agreement with previous experimental studies. We find that \u223c45 surfactant molecules aggregate to form a spherical micelle with a radius of gyration of 14.2 \u00c5 and that the larger micelles are more ellipsoidal. The surfactant tail groups are hidden away from the solvent to form a central dry hydrophobic core. This is surrounded by a disordered corona containing the surfactant headgroups, counterions, water, and some alkyl groups from the hydrophobic tails. We find a Stern layer of 0.7 bromide counterion per surfactant molecule, in which the bromide counterions maintain their hydration shells. The atomistic resolution of this technique provides us with unprecedented detail of the physicochemical properties of the micelle in its solvent.",

The complexes were shown to be efficient initiators for the ring opening polymerisation of rac-lactide. The Al(III) complexes were more controlled than their Ti(IV) analogues, producing PLA with a moderate isotactic bias and narrow molecular weight distribution. The molecular weight of the resultant polymer, for the Al(III) system, could be controlled by the amount of benzyl alcohol added initiator indicating that these systems show immortal behaviour.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

However, with homopiperazine salan ligands, 1:1 ligand-to-metal complexes were observed both in solution and in the solid state. Interestingly, for the homopiperazine complexes the isopropoxide ligands are trans to one another in the solid state, most likely because of the rigid nature of the homopiperazine backbone. All homopiperazine HfIV and ZrIV complexes were tested for the ring-opening polymerisation (ROP) of rac-lactide. The complexes are active and produce polylactide with narrow polydispersity indices. The kinetics and living characteristics of the polymerisation have also been investigated.",

Comparison of experiment with theory suggests the ratio of anisotropic diffusion coefficients in the directions tangential and perpendicular to the electrode surface varies over two orders of magnitude (from 0.04 to 3.3) with increasing concentration of the redox analyte. This is understood through the occurrence of a long-range charge transfer across the pseudophase\u2009|\u2009pseudophase boundary interface, occurring as a result of differential diffusivities of the redox probe within the surfactant and aqueous subphases. These data and their dependence on the analyte concentration empower, in a proof-of-concept, the estimation of the partition equilibrium constant (KP); the value estimated for the small electroactive-drug mimetic considered is log KP = 2.01 \u00b1 0.05 (at 294 \u00b1 2 K) and is in agreement with that envisaged for its partition between n-octanol and water. It is suggested that only measurements at low analyte loadings allow for interphase electron transfers to be neglected, since then percolation effects appear to dominate the Faradaic current.",

Under these unusual conditions an aqueous microphase present at the gas | salt | electrode interface allows voltammograms to be obtained and redox processes to be analysed. It is demonstrated that the 2-electron 2-proton reduction of FAD can be used as reporter redox system to determine local pH at the electrode | gas | salt interface as pH 15, 12, 7 for contacts to K3PO4, K2HPO4, and KH2PO4, respectively. Exposure to gases such as carbon dioxide is shown to lead to unexpected changes in surface pH. In the future, bio-electrochemical microphase processes under halophilic conditions could be useful for air-quality and rapid gas sensing devices.",

The reaction is readily accessible at room temperature, and a computed activation barrier of \u0394E \u2021calcd = +11.8 kcal/mol is found when the NHC 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene is employed as the external base.

Their aqueous solution properties were investigated by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) over a temperature range of 25\u201365 \u00b0C. For LPEI-comb-LPEI polymers the particle distributions were mono-, bi-, or trimodal depending upon the temperature and/or polymer composition. The particles tended to decrease in size upon heating due to the weakening of intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds between \u2212NH groups of the polymers and also with water molecules. However, the aggregates formed from the LPEI-comb-LPEI polymers featuring longer main chains, shorter branches, and lower grafting densities were more resistant to heat-induced disassociation. LPEI-comb-PEtOx particles featured smoother temperature variations of hydrodynamic radius and typically bimodal distributions. The shape and structure of the small LPEI-comb-PEtOx aggregates (average radius \u223c6 nm) as well as their temperature evolution were studied by SANS. A variety of structures were observed, depending upon the polymer composition. The LPEI-comb-PEtOx polymers with low grafting densities and short branches formed elongated aggregates, whereas particles of spherical core\u2013shell structure were observed for the more densely grafted polymer with longer branches. Spherical or rodlike aggregates were monitored in LPEI-comb-LPEI aqueous solutions.",

While offering new hope to many of these people, approximately 10% of these prostheses fail within 10 years. It is thought that cement fracture could be one cause of the failure of the implant. This study was primarily concerned with the effect of storage environment and time period on the work of fracture of Simplex P bone cement. It was found that the storage conditions had a significant influence on the work of fracture of bone cement. In particular, storage at body temperatures embrittled the cement, while storage in fluid media had a plasticizing effect. These trends were related to post-curing chemical changes within the cement mass, specifically the absorption of low molecular mass species from the storage environments, and the leaching of residual monomer from the cement.",

    "abstract": " A combination of experimental studies and density functional theory calculations is used to study C\u2212N bond activation in a series of ruthenium N-alkyl-substituted heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes. These show that prior C\u2212H activation of the NHC ligand renders the system susceptible to irreversible C\u2212N activation. In the presence of a source of HCl, C\u2212H activated Ru(IiPr2Me2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H (1, IiPr2Me2 = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene) reacts to give Ru(IiPrHMe2)(PPh3)2(CO)HCl (2, IiPrHMe2 = 1-isopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene) and propene. The mechanism involves (i) isomerization to a trans-phosphine isomer, 1c, in which hydride is trans to the metalated alkyl arm, (ii) C\u2212N cleavage to give an intermediate propene complex with a C2-metalated imidazole ligand, and (iii) N-protonation and propene/Cl\u2212 substitution to give 2. The overall computed activation barrier (\u0394E\u29e7calcd) corresponds to the isomerization/C\u2212N cleavage process and has a value of +24.4 kcal/mol. C\u2212N activation in 1c is promoted by the relief of electronic strain arising from the trans disposition of the high-trans-influence hydride and alkyl ligands. Experimental studies on analogues of 1 with different C4/C5 carbene backbone substituents (Ru(IiPr2Ph2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H, Ru(IiPr2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H) or different N-substituents (Ru(IEt2Me2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H) reveal that Ph substituents promote C\u2212N activation. Calculations confirm that Ru(IiPr2Ph2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H undergoes isomerization/C\u2212N bond cleavage with a low barrier of only +21.4 kcal/mol. Larger N-alkyl groups also facilitate C\u2212N bond activation (Ru(ItBu2Me2)\u2032(PPh3)2(CO)H, \u0394E\u29e7calcd = +21.3 kcal/mol), and in this case the reaction is promoted by the formation of the more highly substituted 2-methylpropene.",

Redox activity of the bound guest molecule is of interest for electrochemical conversions and electrocatalysis within pores. For the reduction of alizarin red S charge compensating proton uptake into pores is expected. However, it is shown here that alizarin red S redox processes in UMCM-1 immersed in aqueous electrolyte, ethanolic electrolyte, and in acetonitrile electrolyte media are dominated instead by surface processes and the potential driven reductive release of leuco-alizarin red S into the surrounding solution. Self-mediation via released alizarin red S occurs, whereas in acetonitrile a cobaltocene redox mediator is employed for the potential driven redox release of alizarin red S from the UMCM-1 host lattice.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSmall redox active molecules such as alizarin red S are readily adsorbed and bound into redox-inactive metal\u2013organic framework hosts such as UMCM-1. Redox activity of the bound guest molecule is of interest for electrochemical conversions and electrocatalysis within pores. For the reduction of alizarin red S charge compensating proton uptake into pores is expected. However, it is shown here that alizarin red S redox processes in UMCM-1 immersed in aqueous electrolyte, ethanolic electrolyte, and in acetonitrile electrolyte media are dominated instead by surface processes and the potential driven reductive release of leuco-alizarin red S into the surrounding solution. Self-mediation via released alizarin red S occurs, whereas in acetonitrile a cobaltocene redox mediator is employed for the potential driven redox release of alizarin red S from the UMCM-1 host lattice.",

These composite films were used to fabricate bilayer cantilevers that can perform efficient and tuneable mechanical actuation based on the spin transition. A prototype device that uses the spin transition phenomenon to convert electrical energy into mechanical motion through Joule heating is described.

Simple, facile, and accurate assessment of temperature, especially for surface or body thermal mapping, is one of the challenges that must be addressed when developing new materials or technologies for thermometers. Here, we introduce a temperature detection strategy based on a 3D cross-correlative matrix derived from fluorescence response patterns of an organic probe in three solvation envelopes. The intermolecular interactions, such as excimer or exciplex formation, intramolecular charge transfer and solvent relaxation processes, between the probe and molecule surroundings, are attributed to the unique temperature-dependent optical behaviors in different solutions. The precise temperature detection originated from apparent variations in fluorescence intensity and wavelength upon temperature change in these solvents. This enabled the construction of a comprehensive temperature sensor array, which gives a unique visible color pattern of signals as a read-output discernible by the naked eye. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, a new strategy for facile and non-destructive thermal mapping of a crystal surface is presented.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The performance of dye-sensitized solar cells built from ZnO building blocks with different morphology, (a) randomly oriented nanoparticle network and (b) nanowire arrays, was compared. The nanoparticle networks were prepared by the standard doctor blade technique from commercial ZnO powders and the nanowire arrays were electrodeposited in aqueous media. Two different lengths for the nanowire arrays (2.5 and 5 \u00b5m) were considered. The characterization included electron microscopy, adsorption measurements, optical spectroscopy, current\u2013voltage characteristics, open-circuit voltage versus light intensity, incident-photon-to-current efficiency, open circuit voltage decay and impedance spectroscopy under illumination. In spite of the smaller dye loadings of the nanowires with respect to the nanoparticles, the former showed a remarkably effective integrated optical absorption (in the range from 370 to 700 nm, 57% versus 69% for the latter). However the photocurrents for nanowires were lower than expected from this good absorption, which suggests that recombination rather than solar light harvesting can be the limiting factor in these nanowire-based solar cells. The impedance analysis and the open-circuit voltage decays showed smaller recombination resistances and shorter lifetimes for the nanowire-based solar cells. However, the interpretation of the recombination resistances, capacitances and lifetimes in the case of the nanowires is likely affected by space-charge effects and back-reaction through the substrate. An understanding of the effects discovered in this study is very valuable for the development of strategies to enhance the energy conversion efficiency for the ZnO nanowire array based solar cells.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The photovoltaic performance of ZnO-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) has been studied for three different configurations involving two dyes and two types of electrolytes with the iodide/iodine as redox mediator: ZnO/N719/organic solvent electrolyte (C1), ZnO/D149/organic solvent electrolyte (C2), and ZnO/N719/ionic liquid electrolyte (C3). The DSCs were characterized by measuring current\u2013voltage curves and photovoltage as a function of light intensity and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD). The results demonstrate the good light harvesting properties of the D149 dye and highlight the photovoltage limitation of the solvent-free (ionic liquid) electrolyte. The intensity dependence of the photovoltage and the OCVD, EIS, and IMVS results provide evidence of the nonlinear character of the recombination kinetics. It has been found that by combining EIS and IMPS data it is possible to overcome the problem of transport resistance determination for cells where there is no clear transmission line feature in the impedance measurements. The resulting electron diffusion lengths (Ln) indicate good electron collection for all studied cells, pointing to poor injection as the main limitation in DSCs based on the ZnO semiconductor.",

The surface coverage of the assembly and its topography were found to be dependent on the dielectric permittivity of the substrate and the strength of the electrostatic interactions between polyanions and polycations. For poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PAH/PSS), a strongly interacting polyelectrolyte couple, no dependency of the surface morphology on the physical properties of the underlying substrate was observed. In contrast, the weakly interacting pair poly(L-lysine)/hyaluronic acid (PLL/HA) formed rapidly continuous, flat layers on substrates of low dielectric permittivity and inhomogeneous droplet-films on substrates of high dielectric permittivity. Variations in the dielectric permittivity account for changes in the image charges that are induced in the substrate. These changes influence the balance between repulsive electrostatic forces (and image forces) and attractive van der Waals interactions, and thus cause the differences in surface morphology. Differences in surface charge did not influence the morphology of the polyelectrolyte multilayers, but higher surface charge resulted in more polymeric material adsorbed on the surface. A comparison between (PLL/HA) multilayers with and without an initial layer of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) supports this hypothesis.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "One-step deposition of photoelectrochemically active BiVO4 (monoclinic) from a polyethylene glycol (PEG300) precursor paint onto titanium substrates is demonstrated to lead to more complex multioxide phase films. Photocurrents in 0.5\u00a0M Na2SO4 remain relatively low when compared to those reported on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates, possibly due to the effect of detrimental underlying titanium oxide phases or mixed phases. For comparison, the one-step deposition is demonstrated also for the direct formation of V2O5 nanocrystalline films, which also exhibited low photoelectrochemical activity. Impregnation of nanocrystalline V2O5 with aqueous Bi3+ is shown to cause substantial recrystallization with formation of much more photoactive BiVO4. In particular, on low-temperature (high surface area) nano-V2O5 (400\u00a0\u00b0C) and after further mild annealing at 400\u00a0\u00b0C much improved photoelectrochemical water oxidation activity (ca. 0.3\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122 at 1.0\u00a0V vs Ag/AgCl (KCl (3\u00a0M) at 0.1-W\u00a0cm\u22122 xenon lamp radiation) is observed.

    "abstract": "AbstractA life cycle assessment (LCA) has been conducted on the growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) via catalytic chemical vapour deposition (cCVD). Using a directly measured process, a cradle-to-gate approach has been employed for this assessment whereby analysis of the synthetic routes of the reactants used, the process energy inputs, the equipment infrastructure and generated emissions have been assessed to determine the environmental impacts of the MWNT product. Conducting an LCA has allowed the major and, arguably just as informative, minor contributors to the environmental impact of MWNT growth via a cCVD synthesis to be quantified. The high embodied energy of MWNT synthesis is often quoted as the major embodied impact in carbon nanotube growth. However, previously unmeasured contributions of the embodied impacts of the equipment infrastructure have been shown to be in the same order of magnitude in terms of environmental damage during the growth period of the MWNTs, other life cycle stages associated with the production of the chemical reactants used have a very minimal effect on the overall environmental impact due to the relatively small quantities involved in MWNT synthesis. Unique among similar studies is the capture of the impacts attributed to all chemical reactants involved in the cCVD synthesis of MWNTs.",

A generator\u2013collector configuration is employed so that on one electrode nitrate is reduced to nitrite and on the second electrode nitrite is oxidised back to nitrate. The resulting redox cycle gives rise to a specific and enhanced current signal which is exploited for sensitive and reliable measurement of nitrite/nitrate in the presence of oxygen.The electrode design is based on a dual-plate microtrench (approximately 15\u00a0\u00b5m inter-electrode gap) fabricated from gold-coated glass and with a nano-silver catalyst for the reduction of nitrate. Fine tuning of the phosphate buffer pH is crucial for maximising collector current signals whilst minimising unwanted gold surface oxidation. A limit of detection of 24\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM nitrate and a linear concentration range of 200\u20131400\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM is reported for the microtrench sensor in phosphate buffer and dilute horse serum. Relative standard deviations for repeat measurements were in the range 1.8\u20136.9% (n=3) indicating good repeatability in both aqueous and biological media. Preliminary method validation against the standard chemiluminescence method used in medical laboratories is reported for nitrate analysis in serum.",

    "abstract": " Atomistic simulations were used to investigate the surface structure and stability of siliceous and sodium aluminosilicate (Na-A) forms of the zeolite LTA. First, the surface structures were optimized with static lattice minimization. These simulations predict that the single 4-ring termination of {100} and the double 4-ring of {111} are equally stable for siliceous LTA. The inclusion of aluminum ions into the framework stabilizes the {100} relative to the {111} surface. One consequence of this change in surface stability is that the predicted equilibrium morphology changes from spherical for purely siliceous to cubic. Slabs of LTA were then immersed in water and simulated using molecular dynamics. The siliceous LTA was found to have hydrophobic regions, whereas in the aluminosilicate the water density resides at distinct crystallographic sites. The zeolite surfaces were shown to impose significant water ordering near the surfaces. This, in turn, affects the water diffusivity. The diffusivity of water is correlated with water structure, which leads to clear anisotropy in the diffusion coefficient. The presence of water is also found to increase the surface stability of the {100} surfaces. Finally, we found that Na+ ions leach into the solution, migrating between surface adsorption sites and moving through the 6- and 8-rings, hence forming a diffuse sodium layer above the LTA surface, which also has important implications for atom transport near zeolite surfaces.",

The catalysts combine the reverse-water gas shift reaction with the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into hydrocarbons (HCs) often employed as fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry; offering the potential synthesis of HCs void of fossil fuel extraction. The catalysts operational performance was shown to vary considerably dependent on the specific iron:palladium loadings. LCA results afforded insight into \u2018green\u2019 catalyst design, palladium addition vastly improves catalyst performance. However, with such a high embodied environmental impact a trade-off is witnessed whereby the continual addition of palladium, although shows favourable CO2 conversion and HC yields, does not return a sufficient environmental offset in terms of produced HCs to cover the embodied impacts present in its formation. With the present laboratory setup their embodied environmental impacts are several orders of magnitude more impactful than traditional process pathways, largely due to the electricity use; a switch to renewable generators can reduce the overall process impacts by 90%, a significant step in increasing the competitiveness of the process, a use of renewable electricity in the synthesis of hydrogen further strengthens the case for its use in HC production has environmental merit. Indeed, from a material exchange perspective the H2 consumes is of a lesser environmental impact than those offset through the HCs produced. As with all laboratory processes, it is very likely that process scale-up and refinement will further enhance the results witnessed in this study.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " Human O-GlcNAcase plays an important role in regulating the post-translational modification of serine and threonine residues with \u03b2-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharide unit (O-GlcNAc). The mechanism of O-GlcNAcase involves nucleophilic participation of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate to displace a glycosidically linked leaving group. The tolerance of this enzyme for variation in substrate structure has enabled us to characterize O-GlcNAcase transition states using several series of substrates to generate multiple simultaneous free-energy relationships. Patterns revealing changes in mechanism, transition state, and rate-determining step upon concomitant variation of both nucleophilic strength and leaving group abilities are observed. The observed changes in mechanism reflect the roles played by the enzymic general acid and the catalytic nucleophile. Significantly, these results illustrate how the enzyme synergistically harnesses both modes of catalysis; a feature that eludes many small molecule models of catalysis. These studies also suggest the kinetic significance of an oxocarbenium ion intermediate in the O-GlcNAcase-catalyzed hydrolysis of glucosaminides, probing the limits of what may be learned using nonatomistic investigations of enzymic transition-state structure and offering general insights into how the superfamily of retaining glycoside hydrolases act as efficient catalysts.",

The chiral auxiliary is prepared in four steps from N-Boc-L-tyrosine on a multigram scale in high yield and attached to Merrifield-Cl resin via its phenolic group to afford a solid-supported chiral auxiliary for asymmetric synthesis that takes \u223c7 d to prepare. A procedure for its N-acylation is reported and a method for carrying out diastereoselective solid-supported Evans' syn-aldol reactions is described, with aldol products being cleaved from the polymer by either hydrolysis or reduction. The use of the supported auxiliary for two sequential 'on-bead' reactions has been demonstrated for the synthesis of a chiral cyclopropane aldol and a \u03b3-lactone in a >95:5 diastereomeric ratio. These polymer-supported reactions are carried out in IRORI Kan resin capsules to protect the polymer support from mechanical degradation, thus allowing multiple on-bead reactions to be performed.",

They may be used to quantify the extent of progress along a reaction coordinate at a reaction's transition state or alternatively the extent of similarity between a reaction's transition state and some reference transformation. This critical review outlines correlative procedures for the treatment of experimentally-determined free energy relationships with a particular focus on enzyme-catalyzed group transfers. The reasons for observed non-linearities in free energy relationships are considered. Attention is paid to the influences of changes in kinetic mechanism (e.g. general-acid catalyzed versus uncatalyzed reactions, and the competition between associative, dissociative and concerted modes of group transfer), changes in rate-determining step and the choice of an appropriate reference reaction. The relationship between experimental data and physical/theoretical models of reactivity is discussed (191 references).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper reports on the adaptation of standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) technology for biocompatibility, enabling a low-cost solution for drug discovery pharmacology, neural interface systems, cell-based biosensors and electrophysiology. The basis for the process is the anodisation of IC aluminium electrodes to form nanoporous alumina. The porous alumina was electrochemically thinned to reduce the alumina electrode impedance. For applications where a porous electrode surface is either preferred or acceptable, we demonstrated that porosity can be manipulated at room temperature by modifying the anodising electrolyte to include up to 40% polyethylene glycol and reducing the phosphoric acid concentration from 4% (w/v) to 1%. For applications requiring a planar microelectrode surface, a noble metal was electrodeposited into the pores of the alumina film. Limited success was achieved with a pH 7 platinum and pH 5 gold cyanide bath but good results were demonstrated with a pH 0.5 gold chloride bath which produced planar biocompatible electrodes. A further reduction in impedance was produced by deposition of platinum-black, which may be a necessary additional step for demanding applications such as neuronal recording. During this work a capability for real-time electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was developed to study anodisation, barrier oxide thinning, oxide breakdown and electrodeposition processes. To study the pore morphology, focused ion beam (FIB) was employed to produce cross-sectional cuts of the IC features which were inspected by SEM with an \u2018In-lens\u2019 detector.The anodisation process and the optional electrodeposition steps require only simple bench equipment operated at room temperature and is therefore a viable route for manufacturing low-cost biocompatible electrodes from standard CMOS ICs.",

The materials crystallise with a quadrupled perovskite unit cell, similar to that of La2Ba2Cu2Sn2O11 containing alternating double layers of copper and titanium/tin. Decreasing lanthanide size and increasing titanium content is associated with a marked unit cell contraction and a reduction in the mismatch between the different double-layer dimensions. A reduction in the copper\u2013oxygen distances in the CuO2 planes from 2.007 \u00c5 in La2Ba2Cu2Sn2O11 to 1.951 \u00c5 in Gd2Ba2Cu2Ti2O11 produces a copper\u2013oxygen interaction similar to that found in high-temperature superconductors.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The defect chemistry and cation doping behaviour of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-polymorphs of Li3FeF6 have been investigated by advanced atomistic modelling techniques. Our simulations show good reproduction of both monoclinic (\u03b1) and orthorhombic (\u03b2) experimental structures, which are related to the cryolite crystal structure. The most favourable defect types are found to be the Li Frenkel and off-stoichiometry (Li-excess) disorder, suggesting that interstitial lithium is possible in the cryolite structure, and is important in rationalizing the lithium intercalation chemistry. Monovalent dopant substitution for Li and divalent substitution for Fe are energetically favourable, and could be a synthesis strategy to optimise the electrochemical behaviour of Li3FeF6.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this work, a new technique, suitable for chemically-heterogeneous materials, has been used to characterise the structural properties of porous heterogeneous catalysts. A liquid\u2013liquid exchange (LLE) process within nanoporous catalysts has been followed using NMR relaxometry and NMR diffusometry. In order to validate the new technique, two model materials were used. First, a chemically-pure, sol\u2013gel silica, with a simple, mono-disperse pore-space, was studied. The second model material was a bidisperse, eggshell Pt\u2013alumina catalyst. The Pt\u2013alumina catalyst was studied both fresh, and coked following chemical reaction. The degree of structural and chemical complexity added by coking was restricted by the localisation of the coke deposition to the Pt-eggshell layer. Under so-called \u2018metered\u2019 supply conditions, when a high affinity liquid (water) displaced a low affinity liquid (cyclohexane) from the sol\u2013gel silica, entrapment of the low affinity liquid was observed which was similar to that observed in mercury porosimetry. In a similar experiment, comparing LLE in fresh and coked samples of the Pt\u2013alumina catalyst pellets, it was found, for the fresh sample, that water initially displaced cyclohexane from a sub-set of the most accessible, smallest pores, as might expected under metered conditions, but this did not occur for coked catalysts. This finding suggested coking had removed some smaller pores located close to the surface of the pellet, in agreement with where the Pt-metal was preferentially located and coking was known to have occurred.",

    "abstract": "Organic\u2013inorganic metal halide perovskites have demonstrated high power conversion efficiencies in solar cells and promising performance in a wide range of optoelectronic devices. The existence and stability of bound electron\u2013hole pairs in these materials and their role in the operation of devices with different architectures remains a controversial issue. Here we demonstrate, through a combination of optical spectroscopy and multiscale modelling as a function of the degree of polycrystallinity and temperature, that the electron\u2013hole interaction is sensitive to the microstructure of the material. The long-range order is disrupted by polycrystalline disorder and the variations in electrostatic potential found for smaller crystals suppress exciton formation, while larger crystals of the same composition demonstrate an unambiguous excitonic state. We conclude that fabrication procedures and morphology strongly influence perovskite behaviour, with both free carrier and excitonic regimes possible, with strong implications for optoelectronic devices.",

Inspired by this process, we have developed a signal amplification methodology that utilises the selectivity and high activity of enzymes in combination with the robustness and generality of an organometallic catalyst, achieving a hybrid biological and synthetic catalyst cascade. A proligand enzyme substrate was designed to selectively self-immolate in the presence of the enzyme to release a ligand that can bind to a metal pre-catalyst and accelerate the rate of a transfer hydrogenation reaction. Enzyme-triggered catalytic signal amplification was then applied to a range of catalyst substrates demonstrating that signal amplification and signal transduction can both be achieved through this methodology.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

In both materials there is linear O\u2013Cu\u2013O coordination and a band of Cu 3d states sits above a band of O 2p states, but with strong hybridisation between the two. The Pb ions in PbCu2O2 introduce new states of dominant Pb 6s atomic character below the bottom of the O 2p valence band together with states of mixed Pb 6s, O 2p and Cu 3d character at the top of the O 2p valence band. Hole states introduced by K doping in PbCu2O2 are shown to reside in anisotropic sites with clearly defined hyperfine couplings to 63Cu as revealed by EPR. Broadening of the EPR signal in K-doped SrCu2O2 is associated with averaging of the g value and Cu hyperfine anisotropy due to facile hole hopping. It is concluded that replacement of Sr with Pb does not facilitate delocalisation of the holes.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "A series of Cp*IrIII dimers have been synthesized to elucidate the mechanistic viability of radical oxo-coupling pathways in iridium-catalyzed O2 evolution. The oxidative stability of the precursors toward nanoparticle formation and their oxygen evolution activity have been investigated and compared to suitable monomeric analogues. We found that precursors bearing monodentate NHC ligands degraded to form nanoparticles (NPs), and accordingly their O2 evolution rates were not significantly influenced by their nuclearity or distance between the two metals in the dimeric precursors. A doubly chelating bis-pyridine\u2013pyrazolide ligand provided an oxidation-resistant ligand framework that allowed a more meaningful comparison of catalytic performance of dimers with their corresponding monomers. With sodium periodate (NaIO4) as the oxidant, the dimers provided significantly lower O2 evolution rates per [Ir] than the monomer, suggesting a negative interaction instead of cooperativity in the catalytic cycle. Electrochemical analysis of the dimers further substantiates the notion that no radical oxyl-coupling pathways are accessible. We thus conclude that the alternative path, nucleophilic attack of water on high-valent Ir-oxo species, may be the preferred mechanistic pathway of water oxidation with these catalysts, and bimolecular oxo-coupling is not a valid mechanistic alternative as in the related ruthenium chemistry, at least in the present system.",

    "abstract": " Empirically, intrinsic defects in SnO2 are known to give rise to a net oxygen substoichiometry and n-type conductivity; however, the atomistic nature of the defects is unclear. Through first-principles density functional theory calculations, we present detailed analysis of both the formation energies and electronic properties of the most probable isolated defects and their clustered pairs. While stoichiometric Frenkel and Schottky defects are found to have a high energetic cost, oxygen vacancies, compensated through Sn reduction, are predicted to be the most abundant intrinsic defect under oxygen-poor conditions. These are likely to lead to conductivity through the mobility of electrons from Sn(II) to Sn(IV) sites. The formation of Sn interstitials is found to be higher in energy, under all charge states and chemical environments. Although oxygen interstitials have low formation energies under extreme oxygen-rich conditions, they relax to form peroxide ions (O22\u2212) with no possible mechanism for p-type conductivity.",

Different classes of NHCs, (e.g., 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene, 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolin-2-ylidene, and their six- and seven-membered analogues and 1,3-bis(dimethyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) were employed as nucleophiles in these C\u2013C bond-forming reactions yielding the novel complexes in essentially quantitative yields.

    "abstract": "The electronic structures of HgO and ${\\mathrm{Tl}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ have been investigated by valence and core-level x-ray photoemission, x-ray absorption, and x-ray emission spectroscopies. Valence-band photoemission under Al $K\\ensuremath{\\alpha}$ excitation is dominated by the metal $5d$ partial density of states and thus provides a sensitive probe of shallow core mixing into the O $2p$ valence-band states. Conversely O $K$ shell emission is determined by the O $2p$ partial density of states and therefore allows the extent of corresponding mixing of O $2p$ character into the shallow core states to be measured. The experimental work is supported by band-structure calculations carried out within the framework of density-functional theory. It is shown that the bonding in HgO involves significant mixing between O $2p$ states and both Hg $6s$ and shallow core $5d$ states: the calculated O $2p$ partial density of states mirrors the O $K$ shell emission spectrum and reveals significant O $2p$ character within the shallow core Hg $5d$ states. There is, however, little direct on-site mixing between the Hg $6s$ and $5d$ states. In ${\\mathrm{Tl}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$, the hybridization of the deeper metal $5d$ states with O $2p$ states is much less pronounced than in HgO. Moreover, the states at the bottom of what is conventionally regarded as the O $2p$ valence band are found in fact to have very strong Tl $6s$ atomic character. The photoemission spectrum of ${\\mathrm{Tl}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ shows a well-defined metallic Fermi edge: the shape of the structure around the photoemission onset suggests that the metallic nature of ${\\mathrm{Tl}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ arises from an occupation of states above the main valence-band edge, probably arising from oxygen vacancy defects. The conduction electrons of ${\\mathrm{Tl}}_{2}{\\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ are strongly perturbed by ionization of Tl core levels, giving rise to distinctive plasmon satellites in core x-ray photoemission spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAn amperometric assay for the determination of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in urine has been developed without the need for sample preparation. A screen-printed carbon electrode modified with the electrocatalyst cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC\u2013SPCE) and covered with a cellulose acetate membrane (CAM) serves as the sensor. The sensor detects hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is produced as a result of the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate oxidase (PyOd), in the presence of Pi, oxygen, and cofactors. Following optimization of solution conditions, and in the presence of a urine sample, a linear range was found to exist between the rate of current increase and phosphate concentration over the range of 2.27\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 to 1.81\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0M, and the limit of detection was found to be 4.27\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0M. The assay was applied to the determination of phosphate ions in the urine of a normal subject, and the mean concentration in unspiked urine was found to be 3.40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0M with a coefficient of variation of 8.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a05). The mean recovery of phosphate added to urine samples was 98.7% with a coefficient of variation of 5.5% (n\u00a0=\u00a03). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report of an amperometric assay for Pi that incorporates a CoPC\u2013SPCE as the sensing device.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe oxygen electrochemical reduction at nitrogen treated TiO2 nanotubes electrode shows distinctive and well-separated 2-electrons reduction peaks. The oxygen reduction was investigated in alkaline solution at titanium oxide nanotube (TON) arrays fabricated by anodizing of titanium foil in hydrogen fluoride solution followed by annealing at 450\u00a0\u00b0C in nitrogen (TON-N2) atmosphere. The morphology of the arrays was characterized by SEM and the electrochemical behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry in potassium ferrocyanide and alkaline solutions. The treated TON arrays showed a significant enhancement in conductivity and in the activity for reduction of O2 in alkaline media in comparison to the data of plain TiO2. TON arrays annealed in N2 showed a unique electrochemical behavior of two well-resolved 2-electrons O2 reduction peaks in contrast to TON arrays annealed air, which only showed a single reduction peak at more negative potential. At TON-N2 arrays, hydrogen peroxide was detected as the main product during the first reduction. The switch in mechanism is proposed to be due to the presence of oxygen vacancies at the surface of titania nanotube arrays. The finding is of a high importance for the selective production of hydrogen peroxide by electrochemical reduction of oxygen in alkaline media using TiO2 nanotubes electrode.",

    "abstract": " High intensity microwave radiation is (self-)focused at metal electrodes immersed in aqueous electrolyte solutions to generate highly localized superheating and convection effects. It is shown that, for an electrode pointing downward, low intensity microwave radiation causes density driven convective flow (upward), which at the onset of boiling abruptly switches to a fast jet of liquid moving away from the electrode surface (downward). This \u201cjet-boiling\u201d phenomenon allows extremely high rates of mass transport and mixing to be realized at the electrode surface. Cyclic voltammograms obtained at electrodes placed into a microwave field show very strong mass transport enhancement effects. Cyclic voltammograms recorded at a Pt/Pt ring\u2212disk electrode system (r1 = 25 \u03bcm, r2 = 32 \u03bcm, r3 = 32.4 \u03bcm) in the presence of microwave radiation are employed to further explore mass transport effects under microwave conditions. Mass transport coefficients, collection efficiencies, and temperatures are determined as a function of microwave intensity.  ",

    "abstract": "An amperometric biosensor for phosphate ion is described that is based on a cobalt phthalocyanine modified screen-printed carbon electrode (CoPC-SPCE). The biosensor operation is based on the enzyme pyruvate oxidase (PyOd) which catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, in the presence of inorganic phosphate and O2, to acetyl phosphate, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and CO2. The transducer allows the electrocatalytic oxidation of H2O2 in order to generate the analytical signal. The enzyme was immobilised onto the CoPC-SPCE using a sandwich format. The inner membrane was formed in situ by depositing an acetone solution containing cellulose acetate first onto the transducer surface. The enzyme and cofactors were then deposited onto this layer and allowed to dry; finally a second aliquot of the cellulose acetate solution was deposited onto the enzyme layer and allowed to dry. The biosensor was characterised by amperometry in stirred solution to produce current-voltage curves and for calibration studies. From these it was deduced that a reliable electrocatalytic response was obtained for phosphate ion; an operating potential of +0.4\u00a0V was selected for the analysis of urine samples. The precision of the response for urine analysis and recovery data for potable water suggests that the biosensor could have applications in clinical and environmental monitoring.",

The immobilisation of the enzyme pyruvate oxidase (PyOd) was investigated using pre-formed cellulose acetate/cellulose nitrate membranes, of different pore sizes, and the cross-linking agent, glutaraldehyde (GLA). The latter method was found to be superior in terms of performance characteristics and also ease of fabrication. A linear range of 2.5\u2013130\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM and limit of detection of 2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM was obtained under optimal conditions. The biosensor also exhibited an excellent response time of just 13\u00a0s\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01, n\u00a0=\u00a03. The biosensor was successfully applied to the measurement of phosphate in pond water samples; the mean recovery of spiked water samples was 103.2%, n\u00a0=\u00a03. The original concentration of phosphate calculated in the water sample (48\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM) was found to be in good agreement with that found using a standard colourimetric method. In addition to the analysis of water samples the biosensor was also applied to the analysis of human urine, with only a simple dilution of the sample, directly into the electrochemical cell, required for analysis. The precision of the biosensors, obtained during the urine analysis was 6.4%, n\u00a0=\u00a06.",

The structures of [Li2Be2F8][C2N2H10], 1, and [Li2Be2F8][CH3NH3]2\u00b7[H2O]2, 2, consist of inorganic layers, constructed from linked [MF4]\r(M = Li, Be) tetrahedra with organic templating cations incorporated between the sheets. For the ethylenediammonium cation, 1, the structure is a C-centred monoclinic cell, (space group C2/c), whereas the methylamine hydrate, 2, crystallises in P21/c, The interlayer regions possess corrugated topologies within which the organic moieties lie with the amine groups directed into the larger pockets.

    "abstract": "This is an exploratory study on the high-pressure (HP) structural evolution of a zeolitic framework (with LEV topology) on the basis of geometric modelling and previously published accurate unit-cell constants measured by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The geometric simulations for 11 P values from 0 to 5\u00a0GPa gives more insight into the HP-behaviour of levyne, showing that the anomalous elastic behaviour of this zeolite observed under hydrostatic conditions at low P (P<1\u00a0GPa) is due to a double change in the compressional mechanism. Since the geometric simulation is not restricted to using the experimentally determined cell parameters, simulations of uniaxial compression along the [001] direction and of compression in the (001) plane have been performed, shedding more light on the compression mechanisms under non-hydrostatic regimes, which are difficult to access experimentally. The mechanisms associated with compressions along different axes provide insight into the hydrostatic compression mechanisms leading to the anomalous elastic behaviour.",

    "abstract": "SummaryA major step in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the ability to survive inside macrophages, where it is exposed to a number of DNA damaging agents. The alternative sigma factor SigG has been shown to be upregulated by DNA damaging agents and by macrophage infection, but not to regulate genes of the DNA repair pathway. Here we show that SigG is expressed from at least two promoters, the most dominant of these being the DNA damage inducible RecA_Ndp promoter. This promoter is located within the annotated coding region of SigG and so the correct translational start site was determined experimentally and found to be 114\u00a0bp downstream of the annotated start site. Examining the gene expression profile of a SigG over-expression strain found a small number of genes to up-regulated, two of these encoded proteins containing glyoxylase-like domains.",

Compound I, [Li2Be2F7][NH4], and compound II, [Li2Be2F7][CH3NH3], both crystallize in orthorhombic space groups:\u2009 Pca21 for I and Cmcm for II. Single crystal analysis reveals that the materials have slightly different 3-D framework topologies for the [Li2Be2F7] framework composed of [LiF4] and [BeF4] tetrahedra connected through doubly and triply bridging fluorides. Both networks can be viewed as sheets formed of 3- and 4-nets that link perpendicular to the sheet, through a bridging fluoride, to form six-membered interlayer pores. The six-membered channels contain the amine species hydrogen-bonded to framework fluoride ions surrounding the interior of the pore. The thermal stability, spectroscopic properties, and both powder X-ray and neutron data of these compounds are reported, along with the single-crystal analysis used to solve the structures.  ",

    "abstract": "Olivine-type phosphates have attracted considerable attention as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. Here, the defect and ion transport properties of the mixed-metal material LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 are investigated by atomistic modeling methods. The intrinsic defect type with the lowest energy is the cation antisite defect, in which Li and Fe/Mn ions exchange positions. As found in the LiFePO4 material, lithium ion diffusion in the mixed-metal system occurs down the b-axis channels following a curved path. Migration energies for Fe and Mn antisite cations on Li sites suggest that Mn defects would impede bulk Li mobility in LiFe0.5Mn0.5PO4 to a greater extent than Fe antisite defects in LiFePO4. Association or binding energies for various defect clusters comprised of lithium vacancies and/or antisite cations are examined.",

Reactivity was probed by evaluating the catalytic ability of these N,O-chelating systems with N-methylaniline and 4-methoxy-N-methylaniline substrates. Enhanced reactivity is observed with amide proligands bearing an ortho-methoxyphenyl group on the nitrogen. 4-Methoxy-N-methylaniline is found to be more prone to undergo C\u2013H functionalization via hydroaminoalkylation than N-methylaniline. The use of the related substrate 2-methoxy-N-methylaniline is not tolerated, and instead C(sp3)\u2013O bond cleavage was observed.",

Y is shown to segregate stronger to surfaces than grain boundaries and to form ordered structures at the interfaces, which may decrease diffusion coefficients.

This water is reversibly lost on heating above \u223c430 K in flowing or static gas environments. Variable temperature powder neutron and X-ray diffraction show that an increase in lattice parameter occurs when water enters the pyrochlore structure and the water molecules are located in the \u03b1 cages displacing a portion of the potassium ions to adjacent sites. On removing water the lattice parameter and structure revert to those of the normal \u03b2-pyrochlore crystallographic description. Hydration has the effect of reducing the onset of superconducting behavior from a critical temperature of 10.25 K in fully dry KOs2O6 to 9.75 K in KOs2O6\u00b70.1H2O.",

    "abstract": "In this study, large area metallic nanotube arrays on flexible plastic substrates are produced by templating the growth of a cosputtered alloy using anodized aluminum oxide membranes. These nanotube arrays are prepared over large areas (ca. squared centimeters) by reducing the residual stress within the thin multilayered structure. The nanotubes are approximately 20 nm in inner diameter, having walls of <10 nm in thickness, and are arranged in a close packed configuration. Optically the nanotube arrays exhibit light trapping behavior (not plasmonic), where the reflectivity is less than 15% across the visible spectra compared to >40% for a flat sample using the same alloy. When the nanotubes are exposed to high relative humidity, they spontaneously fill, with a concomitant change in their visual appearance. The filling of the nanotubes is confirmed using contact angle measurements, with the nanotubes displaying a strong hydrophilic character compared to the weak behavior of the flat sample. The ability to easily fabricate large area nanotube arrays which display exotic behavior paves the way for their uptake in real world applications such as sensors and solar energy devices.Keywords:  hydrophilic effect; nanotechnology; nanotubes; optics; template synthesis",

Complex 1 is the precursor for preparing the homodinuclear complex [{(EtO2C-C\u2227N\u2227C)Pt}2(\u03bc-dmpyz)] (2) and the heterotrinuclear clusters [{(EtO2C-C\u2227N\u2227C)Pt(dmpyz)}2M]X (M = Cu, X = PF6 (3); M = Ag, X = BF4 (4)). Compounds 1, 2, and 4 were studied by X-ray diffraction methods. In the crystal packing of 1 and 2, the molecules display short intermolecular \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 contacts, which control the solid-state emissive behavior. X-ray study on 4 shows two [Pt2Ag] sandwich-type clusters in the asymmetric unit, both with the two square-planar \u201c(R-CNC)Pt(dmpyz)\u201d moieties stabilized by two Pt \u2192 Ag donor\u2013acceptor bonds as well as by \u03b71- and \u03b72-Ag\u2013C interactions. Intramolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 contacts were found between the pyridine rings of the CNC ligands within the same Pt2Ag cluster. 1H and 195Pt NMR studies confirm that the Pt2M cluster is also retained in solution at room temperature. 195Pt NMR spectra of 3 and 4 show signals shifted significantly downfield when comparing with that for the monomer (1), which is attributed to the presence of Pt\u2013M dative bonds. At lower temperatures (T = 193 K), the copper derivative definitely falls apart, whereas the silver one still holds up unbroken. In the solid state at 77 K, compounds 1\u20134 give red emissions arising from 3\u03c0\u03c0 excited states due to the intra- or intermolecular \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 contacts observed in the crystal structures. As expected, in glassy solutions (77 K), compound 3 displays analogous emissions to those from the starting material (1). Complexes 1 and 2 show structured emission bands that are particularly sensitive to the \u03bbex (HE and LE). In contrast, 4 displays an unstructured emission at 680 nm with a shoulder at 556 nm; both are not dependent on the \u03bbex. DFT and TDDFT computational studies have been performed on 1 and 2, which support the conclusions drawn from the photophysical studies.",

Specifically, transition metal catalysts such as palladium, copper, ruthenium, and nickel are described on silica, monolithic, magnetic nanoparticles and polymer supports.

A rich domain structure of twinned molecular dipoles is observed, strongly varying as a function of temperature and applied electric field.

For disordered assemblies of poly-3-hexylthiophene we find that the tail of the density of hole states is approximately exponential with a characteristic energy of 37 meV, which is similar to experimental values. This tail of states arises mainly from variations in the electronic coupling between neighbouring monomers, and is only slightly influenced by interchain coupling. Thus, knowledge of the disorder in torsion between neighbouring monomers is sufficient to estimate the density of states for the polymer. However, the intrachain torsional disorder is determined largely by the packing of the chains rather than the torsional potential alone. We propose the combination of methods as a tool to design higher mobility conjugated polymers.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The performance of organometallic perovskite solar cells has rapidly surpassed that of both conventional dye-sensitized and organic photovoltaics. High-power conversion efficiency can be realized in both mesoporous and thin-film device architectures. We address the origin of this success in the context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device (spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarization; we also suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott exciton separation and effective ionization of donor and acceptor defects. The photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current\u2013voltage hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.Keywords:  Hybrid perovskite; photovoltaic; density functional theory; ferroelectric",

Porphyrins are selectively accumulated in tumours. Thus two series of carborane-carrying porphyrins were constructed, with additional functionality for attachment of uncharged potentially water-solubilising polyethers. 3-(1,2-Dicarbaclosododecaboran(12)-1-ylmethoxy)benzaldehyde was prepared by protection of the aldehyde of 3-(prop-2-ynyloxy)benzaldehyde as a dithioacetal, treatment with decaborane(14) and deprotection. Condensation with a 3-nitrophenyldipyrromethane gave a separable mixture of meso-(3-nitrophenyl)-meso-(3-carboranylmethoxyphenyl)porphyrins, resulting from extensive scrambling at the porphyrinogen stage. Similarly, condensation of 3-(1,2-dicarbaclosododecaboran(12)-1-yl)benzaldehyde with this dipyrromethane gave an analogous mixture of meso-(3-nitrophenyl)-meso-(3-carboranylphenyl)porphyrins. In this second series, the two regioisomeric bis(nitrophenyl)bis(carboranylphenyl)porphyrins could only be distinguished by X-ray crystallography, their NMR spectra being identical. The nitro groups of the mono(nitrophenyl)porphyrins and the bis(nitrophenyl)porphyrins were reduced to the corresponding amines with tin(II) chloride and the monoamines were coupled with a \u03c9-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) chloroformate of mean MW 600 to give the MeOPEGylated tricarboranyl porphyrins.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

This leads to the occurrence of the so-called long-range proximity effect. Particular examples of noncollinear magnetic interfaces include Bloch and N\u00e9el domain walls. Here, we present results for heterostructures containing Bloch and N\u00e9el domain walls based on self-consistent solutions of the spin-dependent Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes equations in the clean limit. In particular, we investigate the thickness dependence of Bloch and N\u00e9el domain walls on induced spin-triplet pairing correlations and compare with other experimental and theoretical results, including conical magnetic layers as noncollinear magnetic interfaces. It is shown that both Bloch and N\u00e9el domain walls lead to the generation of unequal-spin spin-triplet pairing correlations of similar strength as for conical magnetic layers. However, for the particular heterostructure geometries investigated, only Bloch domain walls lead to the generation of equal-spin spin-triplet pairing correlations. They are stronger than those generated by an equivalent thickness of conical magnetic layers. In order for N\u00e9el domain walls to induce equal-spin spin-triplet pairing correlations, they have to be oriented such that the noncollinearity appears within the plane parallel to the interface region.",

The palladium catalyzed nucleophilic substitution of allylic compounds is an established, efficient and reliable process, and has become an important tool for the synthetic organic chemist. An interesting series of enantiopore monodentate phoshine ligands, which have carboxylic acid functionality and a cyclobutane or cyclopentane backbone are prepared. The use of phoshine-oxazoline ligands in enantioselective allylic substitution and other reactions is also reviewed. The palladium catalyzed cross-coupling process is established as a practical and efficient method of forming carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds utilizing a wide range of coupling partners. Heck reactions provide the common description of a palladium catalyzed coupling of alkenes with aryl or vinyl halides or triflates . The wide utility of the intermolecular Heck reaction in the synthesis of natural products stimulated the search for efficient enantioselective catalysts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAssemblies of gold nanoparticles (nominal 20\u00a0nm in diameter) and poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDAC) are formed on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) and glass substrates in a layer-by-layer deposition process. Electron microscopy imaging suggests clustering and sub-monolayer formation even after multiple deposition cycles. Voltammetric characterisation of the gold-PDDAC assemblies demonstrates at low coverage a facile electron transport perpendicular to the film but essentially insulating characteristics laterally across an inter-electrode gap of 40\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm. However, gentle removal of the organic assembly components (PDDAC) in a room temperature UV-ozonolysis process allows the array of \u201cclean\u201d gold\u2013gold junctions to become electrically conducting due to (i) random multiple tunnel junction pathways and (ii) ionic conductivity through a thin water layer. In this room temperature ozone-cleaned state, the gold assembly is considerably more electrically conducting when compared to thermally cleaned films. The crucial effect of humidity on the resistivity and capacitive currents for gold nanoparticle junction arrays is demonstrated. The gold nanoparticle films readily react with thiols and dithiols from the gas phase which results in a dramatic increase in resistivity. The process is fully reversible and the sensor re-usable after UV-ozonolysis cleaning. Measurements are reported for a range of dithiols with different carbon chain lengths demonstrating that tunnel junction effects are likely to be responsible for the electrical conductivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSimultaneous bipotentiostatic electro-deposition of gold onto two closely spaced platinum disc electrodes produces paired gold electrode junctions. The potential applied during gold deposition onto the two electrodes is chosen to be slightly offset (by 0.5\u00a0mV) to allow for an automatic cut-off mechanism to control the resulting gap size for the paired diffusion junction. The key parameter controlling the gap size is identified as the deposition potential (in relation to the reversible potential for gold deposition) and paired gold electrode junctions are prepared reproducibly from ca. 5\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm estimated gap size (\u2212250\u00a0mV overpotential during deposition) down to approximately 300\u00a0nm estimated gap size (\u221220\u00a0mV overpotential during deposition). The resulting paired junction electrodes are characterized for the reduction of alizarin red S and it is shown that for junctions with ca. 300\u00a0nm gap size: (i) the low concentration sensitivity is improved to allow sub-micromolar concentration measurements and (ii) due to faster mass transport within the smaller gap a transition from reversible to irreversible electron transfer can be observed.",

    "abstract": "A diffusion junction between two paired gold electrodes is created in a bipotentiostatic electro-deposition process. Gold metal is deposited simultaneously on two adjacent disc electrodes (100\u00a0\u03bcm diameter, approximately 125\u00a0\u03bcm separation) until short-circuit conditions trigger the end point of the electro-deposition. Symmetric gold junctions with typically 5\u00a0\u03bcm average inter-electrode gap size, 140\u00a0\u03bcm gap length, and approximately 18\u00a0\u03bcm junction depth are obtained. These paired gold electrodes are employed in generator\u2013collector mode to give well-defined steady-state feedback currents even for extremely low concentrations of analyte (sub-\u03bcM) and without any contributions from capacitive charging. Four redox systems are investigated spanning a wide range of diffusion coefficients: (1) the one-electron oxidation of iodide to iodine, (2) the two-electron oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, (3) the two-electron reduction of alizarin red S, and (4) the one-electron oxidation of the redox protein cytochrome c. Consistent results for these redox systems suggest that (1) the junction zone between the two electrodes is dominating the behaviour of the electrode in particular for the slower diffusing systems and (2) the paired gold electrode junction can be calibrated and employed for electroanalysis at very low concentrations and for a wider range of analytically relevant redox systems.",

Gold is electrodeposited simultaneously on both electrodes with an automated termination mechanism close to short-circuit conditions. Gap junctions (average gap width ca. 4\u2005\u03bcm) are obtained reproducibly and the behavior of the resulting generator\u2013collector electrode system is investigated for two relevant redox systems. First, the chemically reversible oxidation of 1,1\u2032-ferrocenedimethanol in aqueous 0.1\u2005M KCl is studied. Well-defined feedback currents across the electrode junction in generator\u2013collector mode are recorded down to sub-micromolar analyte concentration. Electrochemically reversible voltammetric responses suggest fast heterogeneous electron transfer and this allows further gap geometry analysis. Second, the (apparently) chemically irreversible oxidation of nitric oxide in 0.1\u2005M phosphate buffer solution (pH\u20057) at gold electrodes is re-investigated and, perhaps surprisingly, generator\u2013collector feedback currents are observed for a solution phase intermediate, here tentatively assigned to nitrosonium phosphate, NO+H2PO. The life time of this intermediate, ca. 10\u2005ms, is surprisingly long, given a typical decay time for free NO+ in water of only nanoseconds. The results are consistent with an estimated nitrosonium phosphate association equilibrium constant, K\u2248107\u2005mol\u22121 dm3. Without further optimization of the electrode junction gap geometry, the determination of nitric oxide down to ca. 10\u2005\u03bcM concentration is achieved.

    "abstract": "Ultrasmall, crystalline, and dispersible NiO nanoparticles are prepared for the first time, and it is shown that they are promising candidates as catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation. Using a solvothermal reaction in tert-butanol, very small nickel oxide nanocrystals can be made with sizes tunable from 2.5 to 5 nm and a narrow particle size distribution. The crystals are perfectly dispersible in ethanol even after drying, giving stable transparent colloidal dispersions. The structure of the nanocrystals corresponds to phase-pure stoichiometric nickel(ii) oxide with a partially oxidized surface exhibiting Ni(iii) states. The 3.3 nm nanoparticles demonstrate a remarkably high turn-over frequency of 0.29 s\u20131 at an overpotential of g = 300 mV for electrochemical water oxidation, outperforming even expensive rare earth iridium oxide catalysts. The unique features of these NiO nanocrystals provide great potential for the preparation of novel composite materials with applications in the field of (photo)electrochemical water splitting. The dispersed colloidal solutions may also find other applications, such as the preparation of uniform hole-conducting layers for organic solar cells.",

Here, a systematic comparison of crystal properties, defect chemistry and Li-ion migration behaviour of four polymorphs of Li2MnSiO4 is reported based on the results of atomistic simulations. The four polymorphs examined have Pmn21, Pmnb, P21/n, and Pn symmetry. Lattice energies of all four polymorphs are very similar, with only a small energy preference for the two orthorhombic phases over the monoclinic phases, which explains the difficulty experimentalists have had preparing pure-phase samples. Defect formation energies of the polymorphs are also similar, with antisite Li/Mn defects the most energetically favourable. Detailed analysis of the Li-ion migration energy surfaces reveals high activation energies (around 0.9 to 1.7 eV) and curved trajectories. All four polymorphs are thus expected to be poor Li-ion conductors, requiring synthesis as nanoparticles to facilitate sufficient Li transfer. The results accord well with experimental reports on the structure, relative phase stabilities and electrochemical performance of materials in this system.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Relaxed surface structures and energies are reported for 19 low index planes. The calculated equilibrium morphology takes on a rounded, isometric appearance, with {010}, {201}, {011}, and {100} faces prominent. Almost all of the low energy surfaces are lithium-deficient relative to the bulk lattice, requiring Li vacancies at the surface. The calculated growth morphology exhibits the {010}, {100} and {101} faces, with an elongated hexagonal prism-like shape; this morphology is more consistent with experimentally observed LiFePO4 particles. The exposure of the (010) surface in our calculated equilibrium and growth morphologies is significant since it is normal to the most facile pathway for lithium ion conduction (along the [010] channel), and hence important for the reversible insertion/de-insertion of lithium ions. SEM images of plate-like crystallites from hydrothermal synthesis are also simulated by our methods, and exhibit large (010) faces.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Based on our investigations and those of others, E-ring modified steroids were identified as a useful template for the design of inhibitors of 17\u03b2-HSD type 1, an enzyme involved in the conversion of estrone into estradiol. The synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of N- and C-substituted 1,3,5(10)-estratrien-[17,16-c]-pyrazoles and the corresponding SAR are discussed. Among the N-alkylated analogues, the most potent inhibitor was the 1\u2018-methoxyethyl derivative, 41, with an IC50 of 530 nM in T47-D human breast cancer cells. The X-ray crystal structure of the 1\u2018-isobutyl derivative, 37, was determined. Further optimization of the template using parallel synthesis resulted in a library of C5\u2018-linked amides from which 73 emerged. This pyridylethyl amide had an IC50 of 300 nM and its activity, with that of 41, suggests the importance of hydrogen bond acceptor groups in the pyrazole side chain. Both 41 and 73 displayed selectivity over 17\u03b2-HSD type 2, and preliminary investigations showed 41 to be nonestrogenic in vitro in a luciferase reporter gene assay in contrast to the parent pyrazole 25. Molecular modeling studies, which support these findings, and a QSAR, the predictive power of which was demonstrated, are also presented.  ",

    "abstract": "Charge transfer (CT) state properties at the donor:acceptor interface in organic photovoltaic materials are widely regarded as crucial in determining the charge separation efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices. In this work, we use time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with B3LYP/6-31g* to study the influence of chemical structure on excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and electronic structure. We vertically excite states in a series of polymer:fullerene blends, modeling each blend as an oligomer:fullerene pair in vacuo. Our method reproduces experimentally observed trends in CT state energy with chemical structure as measured by electroluminescence. For oligothiophene:PCBM (PCBM = [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester), we find that Coulomb binding tends to reduce in higher excited CT states. In the case of several isoindigo and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based donors, we find that the first excited state of the pair lies close in energy to the first singlet of the oligomers, and low excited states have hybrid, or incomplete charge transfer, character. The natures and energies of these states are dependent on the fullerene position. We discuss the effect of thiophene substitution in a DPP polymer on charge generation in terms of the calculated CT state properties and rationalize the observed charge separation efficiency of corresponding experimental systems in terms of these calculations.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSamples of Ln3Ba2Mn2Cu2O12\u00b1y, Ln=Sm, Eu, have been synthesized with non-absorbing isotopes and studied by high-resolution powder neutron diffraction. For Ln=Eu, the material was studied before and after annealing in oxygen. Results show that segregation of the manganese and copper between the layer sites is incomplete and that oxygen can also be incorporated between the CuO5 square-based pyramids giving the overall composition Ln3Ba2Mn2Cu2O12.1. Cation size mismatch on the A-type cation sites leads to a local distortion in the oxide sub-lattice in the MnO6 octahedra and consideration of the A-site coordination geometries permits an understanding of the limited lanthanide range for which this structure forms. While the Ln and Ba cations are fully segregated the observed B cation disorder and additional inter-cuprate layer oxygen are likely to preclude observation of superconductivity in this family of materials.",

    "abstract": " The defect chemistry, doping behavior, and ion migration in olivine-type materials LiMPO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and N) are investigated by atomistic simulation techniques. The most favorable intrinsic defect type is found to be the cation antisite defect, in which Li and M ions exchange positions. Li migration is found to occur preferentially down [010] channels, following a curved trajectory. Defect association or binding energies for pair clusters composed of combinations of lithium vacancies, antisite cations, and small polaron species are investigated. Migration energies for divalent antisite cations on Li sites suggest that such defects would impede Li diffusion in LiMPO4 to varying degrees. Calculation of dopant substitution energies for cations with charges +1 to +5 indicate that supervalent doping (e.g., Ga3+, Ti4+, Nb5+) on either Li or M sites is energetically unfavorable and does not result in a large increase in electronic (small polaron) species.",

Empirically, the efficiency of this process appears to be related to the choice of donor and acceptor materials, the resulting sequence of excited state energy levels and the structure of the interface. In order to establish a suitable physical model for the process, a range of different theoretical studies have addressed the nature and energies of the interfacial states, the energetic profile close to the heterojunction and the dynamics of excited state transitions. In this paper, we review recent developments underpinning the theory of charge pair generation and phenomena, focussing on electronic structure calculations, electrostatic models and approaches to excited state dynamics. We discuss the remaining challenges in achieving a predictive approach to charge generation efficiency.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The best conditions for these reactions required the use of an excess of arylboronic acid (4 equiv.), [Rh(COD)2]BF4 as catalyst, and CsF as base in dioxane/H2O (10:1) at 110 \u00b0C. These conditions were also applied to several dipeptides with dehydroalanine residues. The photophysical properties of some of the \u03b2-arylalanines were studied in three solvents with different polarities. Due to the absence of the \u03b1,\u03b2-double bond, the absorption and fluorescence emission of the new compounds are dominated by the photophysical properties of the polycyclic aromatic fluorophores (naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene). Considering the relatively high fluorescence quantum yield of these compounds, some of them may be useful as fluorescent markers for peptides and proteins.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUltrasonic scalers are used in dentistry to remove calculus and other contaminants from teeth. One mechanism which may assist in the cleaning is cavitation generated in cooling water around the scaler. The vibratory motion of three designs of scaler tip in a water bath has been characterised by laser vibrometry, and compared with the spatial distribution of cavitation around the scaler tips observed using sonochemiluminescence from a luminol solution. The type of cavitation was confirmed by acoustic emission analysed by a \u2018Cavimeter\u2019 supplied by NPL. A node/antinode vibration pattern was observed, with the maximum displacement of each type of tip occurring at the free end. High levels of cavitation activity occurred in areas surrounding the vibration antinodes, although minimal levels were observed at the free end of the tip. There was also good correlation between vibration amplitude and sonochemiluminescence at other points along the scaler tip. \u2018Cavimeter\u2019 analysis correlated well with luminol observations, suggesting the presence of primarily transient cavitation.",

Adsorption from 50:50 acetonitrile\u2212tert-butanol onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) allows approximate Langmuirian binding constants of 6.5 \u00d7 104, 2.0 \u00d7 103, 2.0 \u00d7 104, and 1.5 \u00d7 104 mol\u22121 dm3, respectively, to be determined. Voltammetric data obtained in acetonitrile/0.1 M NBu4PF6 indicate reversible one-electron oxidation at Emid = 0.94, 0.91, 0.88, and 0.88 V vs Ag/AgCl(3 M KCl), respectively, with dye aggregation (at high coverage) causing additional peak features at more positive potentials. Slow chemical degradation processes and electron transfer catalysis for iodide oxidation were observed for all four oxidized indolinium cations. When adsorbed onto TiO2 nanoparticle films (ca. 9 nm particle diameter and ca. 3 \u03bcm thickness on FTO), reversible voltammetric responses with Emid = 1.08, 1.16, 0.92, and 0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl(3 M KCl), respectively, suggest exceptionally fast hole hopping diffusion (with Dapp > 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 m2 s\u22121) for adsorbed layers of all four indoline dyes, presumably due to \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking in surface aggregates. Slow dye degradation is shown to affect charge transport via electron hopping. Spectroelectrochemical data for the adsorbed indoline dyes on FTO-TiO2 revealed a red-shift of absorption peaks after oxidation and the presence of a strong charge transfer band in the near-IR region. The implications of the indoline dye reactivity and fast hole mobility for solar cell devices are discussed.",

N719 is adsorbed from acetonitrile onto FTO surfaces giving poor quality partial or multi-layer coverage commencing at 10\u22127\u00a0M concentration. In contrast, from 50% acetonitrile 50% tBuOH solution of N719 Langmuirian adsorption occurs with well-defined mono-layer coverage and a binding constant ca. 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0dm3. The adsorbed N719 exhibits voltammetric oxidation/back-reduction responses with Emid\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.56 (weaker) and 0.68 (dominant)\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl (3\u00a0M\u00a0KCl) and with chemically reversible characteristics at sufficiently high scan rates (ca. 16\u00a0V\u00a0s\u22121). A chemical reaction step involving oxidised N719 at the electrode surface leads to the loss of electrochemical activity at slower scan rates with a first order chemical rate constant of ca. 2.4\u00a0s\u22121. The electro-catalytic oxidation of iodide is demonstrated for both the intact metal complex N719 and the reaction product formed after oxidation. When adsorbed onto TiO2 (porous films made from approximately 9\u00a0nm diameter TiO2 particles, Langmuirian binding constant ca. 105\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0dm3), immersed in acetonitrile (0.1\u00a0M\u00a0NBu4PF6), and at sufficiently fast scan rates (ca. 16\u00a0V\u00a0s\u22121), the N719 metal complex exhibits reversible voltammetric responses (with Emid\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.68\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl (3\u00a0M\u00a0KCl)). At slower scan rates, the voltammetric response again appears irreversible, however, this time without significant degradation of the N719 metal complex at the TiO2 surface. It is shown that the conduction mechanism via electron hopping becomes ineffective due to degradation of FTO-adsorbed N719. In the presence of iodide, the electro-catalytic iodide oxidation process (dark electro-catalysis) is shown to occur predominantly at the N719-modified FTO electrode surface. Implications of this dark-reactivity for the solar cell performance are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Ferrocene-decorated cellulose nanowhiskers were prepared by the grafting of ethynylferrocene onto azide functionalized cotton-derived cellulose nanowhiskers using azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition. Successful surface modification and retention of the crystalline morphology of the nanocrystals was confirmed by elemental analysis, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The coverage with ferrocenyl is high (approximately 1.14 \u00d7 10\u20133 mol g\u20131 or 4.6 \u00d7 1013 mol cm\u20132 corresponding to a specific area of 61 \u00c52 per ferrocene). Cyclic voltammetry measurements of films formed by deposition of ferrocene-decorated nanowhiskers showed that this small spacing of redox centers along the nanowhisker surface allowed conduction hopping of electrons. The apparent diffusion coefficient for electron (or hole) hopping via Fe(III/II) surface sites is estimated as Dapp = 10\u201319 m2s\u20131 via impedance methods, a value significantly less than nonsolvated ferrocene polymers, which would be expected as the 1,2,3-triazole ring forms a rigid linker tethering the ferrocene to the nanowhisker surface. In part, this is believed to be also due to \u201cbottleneck\u201d diffusion of charges across contact points where individual cellulose nanowhiskers contact each other. However, the charge-communication across the nanocrystal surface opens up the potential for use of cellulose nanocrystals as a charge percolation template for the preparation of conducting films via covalent surface modification (with applications similar to those using adsorbed conducting polymers), for use in bioelectrochemical devices to gently transfer and remove electrons without the need for a solution-soluble redox mediator, or for the fabrication of three-dimensional self-assembled conducting networks.",

Special attention is paid to the possible analytical pitfalls of chromatographic separations at enantiomeric level, which could potentially lead to erroneous measurements of enantiomers. Several applications of chiral analysis and results gained in the field are also discussed. Among them are: (i) study of fate and effects of chiral pharmaceuticals in the environment and during wastewater treatment, (ii) estimation of community-wide drugs use via newly emerging field of sewage epidemiology and (iii) usage of chiral drugs as chemical markers of water contamination with sewage.

    "abstract": "AbstractThis is the first study presenting a multi-residue method allowing for comprehensive analysis of several chiral pharmacologically active compounds (cPACs) including beta-blockers, antidepressants and amphetamines in wastewater and digested sludge at the enantiomeric level. Analysis of both the liquid and solid matrices within wastewater treatment is crucial to being able to carry out mass balance within these systems. The method developed comprises filtration, microwave assisted extraction and solid phase extraction followed by chiral liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to analyse the enantiomers of 18 compounds within all three matrices. The method was successfully validated for 10 compounds within all three matrices (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, venlafaxine, desmethylvenlafaxine, citalopram, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol), 7 compounds validated for the liquid matrices only (mirtazapine, salbutamol, fluoxetine, desmethylcitalopram, atenolol, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine) and 1 compound (alprenolol) passing the criteria for solid samples only. The method was then applied to wastewater samples; cPACs were found at concentration ranges in liquid matrices of: 1.7\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 (metoprolol) \u2013 1321\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 (tramadol) in influent, <LOD (desmethylcitalopram and metoprolol) \u2013 506\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 in effluent, and in solid matrix digested sludge: 0.4\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121 (metoprolol) \u2013 275\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121 (citalopram). Enantiomeric profiling revealed that studied compounds were present in analysed samples in non-racemic composition. Furthermore, enantiomeric composition of studied analytes differed in liquid and solid matrices. This demonstrates that not analysing the solid fraction of wastewater may lead to over-estimation of the removal rates of cPACs as well as possible misrepresentation of the enantiomeric fraction of the compounds as they leave the wastewater treatment plant. Consequently risks from cPACs entering the environment might be higher than anticipated.",

Red-emitting phosphorescent iridium complexes based on the [Ir(btp)2(acac)] fragment (where btp is 2-(2\u2018-benzo[b]thienyl)pyridinato and acac is acetylacetonate) have been attached either directly (spacerless) or through a \u2212(CH2)8\u2212 chain (octamethylene-tethered) at the 9-position of a 9-octylfluorene host. The resulting dibromo-functionalized spacerless (8) or octamethylene-tethered (12) fluorene monomers were chain extended by Suzuki polycondensations using the bis(boronate)-terminated fluorene macromonomers 16 in the presence of end-capping chlorobenzene solvent to produce the statistical spacerless (17) and octamethylene-tethered (18) copolymers containing an even dispersion of the pendant phosphorescent fragments. The spacerless monomer 12 adopts a face-to-face conformation with a separation of only 3.6 \u00c5 between the iridium complex and fluorenyl group, as shown by X-ray analysis of a single crystal, and this facilitates intramolecular triplet energy transfer in the spacerless copolymers 17. The photo- and electroluminescence efficiencies of the octamethylene-tethered copolymers 18 are double those of the spacerless copolymers 17, and this is consistent with suppression of the back transfer of triplets from the red phosphorescent iridium complex to the polyfluorene backbone in 18. The incorporation of a \u2212(CH2)8\u2212 chain between the polymer host and phosphorescent guest is thus an important design principle for achieving higher efficiencies in those electrophosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes for which the triplet energy levels of the host and guest are similar.

    "abstract": "AbstractAnalysis of wastewater with an aim of community-wide estimation of drug use is a new and very promising approach. Until now it was very difficult to determine if mass loads of studied drugs were actually originating from consumption, or disposal of unused drugs or production waste. This uncertainty in the estimation of community wide drugs use should not be underestimated. This paper aims to apply for the first time enantiomeric profiling in verifying sources of the presence of MDMA and amphetamine in wastewater based on a case study in two Dutch cities: Utrecht and Eindhoven. The results showed that MDMA is usually present in wastewater due to its consumption (MDMA enriched with R(\u2212)-enantiomer). Excessively high mass loads of MDMA during a sampling campaign in Utrecht in 2011 proved to be racemic indicating direct disposal of unused MDMA possibly as a result of a police raid at a nearby illegal production facility. Enantiomeric profiling was also undertaken in order to verify the origin of unexpectedly high mass loads of amphetamine in the city of Eindhoven in 2011. Unfortunately, a distinction between consumption and direct disposal of unused amphetamine in Dutch wastewater could not be achieved. Further work will have to be undertaken to fully understand sources of amphetamine in Dutch wastewaters.",

    "abstract": "The protein calexcitin was originally identified in molluscan photoreceptor neurons as a 20\u00a0kDa molecule which was up-regulated and phosphorylated following a Pavlovian conditioning protocol. Subsequent studies showed that calexcitin regulates the voltage-dependent potassium channel and the calcium-dependent potassium channel as well as causing the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by binding to the ryanodine receptor. A crystal structure of calexcitin from the squid Loligo pealei showed that the fold is similar to that of another signalling protein, calmodulin, the N- and C-terminal domains of which are known to separate upon calcium binding, allowing interactions with the target protein. Phosphorylation of calexcitin causes it to translocate to the cell membrane, where its effects on membrane excitability are exerted and, accordingly, L. pealei calexcitin contains two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Thr61 and Thr188). Thr-to-Asp mutations which mimic phosphorylation of the protein were introduced and crystal structures of the corresponding single and double mutants were determined, which suggest that the C-terminal phosphorylation site (Thr188) exerts the greatest effects on the protein structure. Extensive NMR studies were also conducted, which demonstrate that the wild-type protein predominantly adopts a more open conformation in solution than the crystallographic studies have indicated and, accordingly, normal-mode dynamic simulations suggest that it has considerably greater capacity for flexible motion than the X-ray studies had suggested. Like calmodulin, calexcitin consists of four EF-hand motifs, although only the first three EF-hands of calexcitin are involved in binding calcium ions; the C-terminal EF-hand lacks the appropriate amino acids. Hence, calexcitin possesses two functional EF-hands in close proximity in its N-terminal domain and one functional calcium site in its C-terminal domain. There is evidence that the protein has two markedly different affinities for calcium ions, the weaker of which is most likely to be associated with binding of calcium ions to the protein during neuronal excitation. In the current study, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to abolish each of the three calcium-binding sites of calexcitin, and these experiments suggest that it is the single calcium-binding site in the C-terminal domain of the protein which is likely to have a sensory role in the neuron.",

In this paper, we present a method of improving the removal of heavy metals by using Eichhornia crassipes roots (ECR) supported on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thin film. The functional groups of the synthesized PMMA sample were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. ECR roots dried fine powder has a small size and large surface area. They contain many polyfunctional metal-binding sites for both cationic and anionic metal complexes. The results show that using 0.1\u00a0g of ECR, about 70\u00a0% of Cd present in the water was removed in 4\u00a0h; while under the same conditions, about 55\u00a0% of Ni was removed. The concentrations of Ni and Cd were measured by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, a promising technique for the elemental analysis of heavy metals.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe characterization of structure over a wide range of length scales from atomic to microns is a common requirement for understanding the behaviour of many soft matter systems. In the case of self-assembling and colloidal materials, the final properties will depend sensitively on intermolecular as well as interparticle interactions. Experimental methods such as wide and small angle scattering, which, between them, cover a wide range of length-scales are therefore growing in importance to better understand and thus exploit these systems. This review covers the growing use of wide angle scattering, either in conjunction with small angle scattering, or applied to systems which have previously been studied using small angle scattering, in order to highlight the complementarity between these two techniques, and the areas where atomistic information has contributed to understanding of the behaviour of systems containing structure at much larger length scales.",

In this tutorial review, we document notable advances in the application of rhodium catalysed conjugate addition processes within the context of synthesis of complex molecules and intermediates in drug discovery.

The formation processes and structures were probed using neutron reflectivity, X-ray reflectivity, off-specular time-resolved scattering, and grazing incidence diffraction. The mesostructures of films prepared with polyethylene oxide, polyethylenimine, and polyacrylamide at various cationic/anionic surfactant molar ratios are compared. The results suggest that polymers having a weak interaction with the surfactants cause a depletion aggregation process that results in a lamellar phase, whereas polymers having a stronger interaction with the surfactants produce more complex mesostructures in the films.",

    "abstract": "We have prepared self-supporting, free-standing titania-surfactant mesostructured films via spontaneous growth on the surface of ethanolic solutions, as an alternative synthetic route to evaporation induced self-assembly. The initial stages of surfactant templating and interfacial film formation in alcoholic solutions of titania with a polyethylene\u2212poly(ethylene glycol) surfactant have been observed by small angle neutron scattering and Brewster angle microscopy. Variation of parameters including the titania precursor concentration, acid concentration, and surfactant concentration allowed formation times and pathways to be probed. These time-resolved observations of titania development represent a novel achievement in formation studies and have allowed a formation mechanism for titania\u2212surfactant films to be proposed. Micelles in solution undergo an initial slow accumulation of titania, followed by rapid growth of a titania shell, followed again by a slow growth period, and these species accumulate at the solution interface to form the film via a phase transition driven by evaporation from the solution surface. This mechanism shows no solution aggregation in early developmental stages and is significant in understanding early solution phase development and for developing new materials based on evaporation induced self-assembly processes as well as for spontaneous growth of films at interfaces.",

The micrograph images showed that the growing silica film exhibited complex, fractal-like patterns. These images have been analyzed to determine the values of the fractal dimension and lacunarity, and the forms of the autocorrelation function and Euclidean crossover behavior of the silica clusters have been observed. These statistical descriptors have been compared with the equivalent properties of simulated images of model structures generated by computer using a particular variant of the cluster\u2212cluster aggregation (CCA) algorithm. Good agreement was found between the characteristic properties of typical experimental images and the simulated images. It was, therefore, suggested that the CCA process is a good model for the growth of the silica films.  ",

Ionic transport has been suggested to be an important factor contributing to these effects; however, the chemical origin of this transport and the mobile species are unclear. Here, the activation energies for ionic migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) are derived from first principles, and are compared with kinetic data extracted from the current\u2013voltage response of a perovskite-based solar cell. We identify the microscopic transport mechanisms, and find facile vacancy-assisted migration of iodide ions with an activation energy of 0.6\u2009eV, in good agreement with the kinetic measurements. The results of this combined computational and experimental study suggest that hybrid halide perovskites are mixed ionic\u2013electronic conductors, a finding that has major implications for solar cell device architectures.",

Here, the defect chemistry, lithium-ion transport pathways, and cell voltages of layered LiFeSO4OH are investigated by atomistic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) methods and compared with the tavorite polymorph. The results indicate that the layered phase exhibits two-dimensional (2D) lithium-ion diffusion with low activation energies of \u223c0.2 eV for long-range transport within the bc-plane, which is important for good rate capability. The tavorite phase also shows 2D lithium-ion diffusion but with higher activation energies of \u223c0.7 eV. Using DFT+U techniques the experimental voltage and structural parameters are accurately reproduced for the tavorite polymorph. For the layered structure, similar accuracy in both cell voltage and structure can only be obtained if a van der Waals functional is included in the DFT methodology to account for the interlayer binding.",

    "abstract": "Numerical self-consistent field theory is used to study the structural characteristics of a polymer brush consisting of end-grafted comb-polymers. A comb-polymer brush is shown to retain the parabolic density profile characteristic of the unbranched brush. Increasing either the number of branches or the length of the side-chains leads to an increase in the height (H) of the brush. This is partly because of the branched structure: it is more favorable to stretch the polymer backbone, while leaving the side-chains almost unstretched. The other reason for the increased stretching is simply because of the extra polymer in the brush due to the branches. We find that it does not matter how the side-chains are distributed along the backbone for the predicted density profile; it is only the total amount of polymer in the side-chains that is important. The effect of branching on the brush height can be captured in a simple scaling law: H \u223c Nb(NT/Nb)2/3, where Nb is the chain length of the polymer backbone, NT is the total chain length, thus including the side-chains, and their ratio NT/Nb is a measure for the amount of branching. The structure of the branched brush is less suitable for keeping away small particles from the grafted interface. It is, however, a good way of increasing the polymer density, and thus its antifouling properties, when the grafting density of the brush is limited.",

    "abstract": " The diffusion length of electrons in high efficiency liquid electrolyte dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells has been investigated using two different approaches. The first method is based on measuring the rise and decay times of the small amplitude photovoltage increment generated by a short laser pulse superimposed on a range of steady-state illumination levels. The advantage of this technique is that it allows the simultaneous measurement of the diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime under identical conditions. In addition to transport-controlled substrate charging, direct injection of electrons into the substrate from dye adsorbed at the contact interface was observed at the high laser pulse energies required for measurements at high dc photovoltages. The second method involves using intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopies (IMPS and IMVS, respectively) to measure the electron diffusion coefficient and electron lifetime at short circuit and open circuit, respectively, as a function of light intensity. The difference between the electron trap occupancies under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions must be accounted for in this case. The diffusion lengths derived from the study are in the range of 40\u221270 \u03bcm, which are at least an order of magnitude greater than the film thickness. This indicates that the electron collection efficiency in the cells is close to 100%.",

    "abstract": "The search for new low cost, safe, and high capacity cathodes for lithium batteries has focused attention recently on Li2FeSiO4. The material presents a challenge because it exhibits complex polymorphism, and when it is electrochemically cycled there is a significant drop in the cell voltage related to a structural change. Systematic studies based on density functional theory techniques have been carried out to examine the change in cell voltages and structures for the full range of Li2FeSiO4 polymorphs (\u03b2II, \u03b3s, and \u03b3II) including the newly elucidated cycled structure (termed inverse-\u03b2II). We find that the cycled structure has a 0.18\u20130.30 V lower voltage than the directly synthesized polymorphs in accord with experimental observations. The trends in cell voltage have been correlated to the change in energy upon delithiation from Li2FeSiO4 to LiFeSiO4 in which the cation\u2013cation electrostatic repulsion competes with distortion of the tetrahedral framework.Keywords:  lithium battery; cathode; silicates; computer simulation; electronic structure",

    "abstract": "In order to study the behavior of photoinjected electrons in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC), steady-state microwave reflectance measurements (33 GHz, Ka band) have been carried out on a working cell filled with electrolyte. The experimental arrangement allowed simultaneous measurement of the light-induced changes in microwave reflectance and open circuit voltage as a function of illumination intensity. In addition, frequency-resolved intensity-modulated microwave reflectance measurements were used to characterize the relaxation of the electron concentration at open circuit by interfacial transfer to tri-iodide ions in the electrolyte. The dependence of the free and trapped electron concentrations on open circuit voltage were derived, respectively, from conductivity data (obtained by impedance spectroscopy) and from light-induced near IR transmittance changes. These electron concentrations were used in the fitting of the microwave reflectivity response, with electron mobility as the main variable. Changes in the complex permittivity of the mesoporous films were calculated using Drude\u2013Zener theory for free electrons and a simple harmonic oscillator model for trapped electrons. Comparison of the calculated microwave reflectance changes with the experimental data showed that the experimental response arises primarily from the perturbation of the real component of the complex permittivity by the high concentration of trapped electrons present in the DSC under illumination. The results suggest that caution is needed when interpreting the results of microwave reflectance measurements on materials with high concentrations of electron (or hole) traps, since an a priori assumption that the microwave response is solely determined by changes in conductivity (i.e., by free electrons) may be incorrect. The intensity-modulated microwave reflectance measurements showed that relaxation of the free and trapped electron concentrations occurs on a similar time scale, confirming that the free and trapped electron populations remain in quasi-equilibrium during the decay of the electron concentration.",

Raman spectroscopy provides a fast, non-destructive and portable strategy for collecting data, which can then be compared against a set of known experimental information. We present a Raman study of a selection of uranyl minerals from Cornwall, UK. This includes the first Raman spectrum published for the uranyl arsenate mineral, nov\u00e1ekite. These spectra were collected under a standard set of conditions, using three excitation wavelengths, 325, 532 and 785 nm, the latter typically providing spectra with little fluorescence and the best resolution. The vibrational properties of these minerals are characterised by the symmetric stretching mode of the uranyl cation, seen between 750\u2013900 cm\u22121, though the exact position varies with respect to the local environment. To discriminate between samples, the rest of the spectrum must be considered; the poly-anions in the structure provide a fingerprint set of Raman bands. An added complication occurs when samples of the same mineral from different mines demonstrate variations in their Raman spectra; this emphasises the need for data to be collected from a variety of locations, but also suggests that other experimental techniques could provide complementary information.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel contact strips separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured as a function of the gap between the contact strips, which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the contact strips exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during transit to the contacts. Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the contact strips to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length. The diffusion length is found to increase with voltage both at open circuit and at the maximum power point.",

Metal sulphides are the ideal candidate materials, but their band gaps are usually too large to absorb significant fractions of visible light. However, by combining Cu+ (low binding energy d10 band) and Sb3+/Bi3+ (low binding energy s2 band), the ternary sulphides CuSbS2 and CuBiS2 are formed, which have been gathering recent interest for solar cell applications. Using a hybrid density functional theory approach, we calculate the structural and electronic properties of these two materials. Our results highlight the stereochemical activity of the Sb and Bi lone pair electrons, and predict that the formation of hole carriers will occur in the Cu d10 band and hence will involve oxidation of Cu(I).\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), the co-assembly of the complex into straight fibers under the function of multiple directional hydrogen bonds and \u00cf\u0080\u2013\u00cf\u0080 stackings is proved. The strong and directional interactions lead to rich dynamic behavior and high degrees of internal order among the complex gelators. The ordered one-dimensional co-assemblies possess useful functions in templated synthesis, molecular recognition, enzyme immobilization, and other biochemistry fields.",

The structure of catena-poly[PhPO3HSnMe3]n has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The SnIV atoms are five-coordinated in all compounds, with the SnC3O2 framework in a trans trigonal bipyramidal arrangement and the PhPO3H- anions being in axial positions. The molecular structure of [PhPO3HSnMe3]n is arranged as a one-dimensional coordination polymer in which planar SnMe3 groups are axially bridged by -O-P-O- linkages of the PhPO3H- ligand. Neighboring chains are linked via O-H\u2219\u2219\u2219O hydrogen bond interactions, generating a layered structure. In the R2NH2(PhPO3H)2SnR\u20323 (R=Cy, Bu; R\u2032=Ph, Me), the SnPh3 or SnMe3 residue is axially coordinated by two monodentate PhPO3H-. The role of the dialkylammonium cation, R2NH2+, is crucial in the lattice building via a hydrogen bond network. These hydrogen bonds contribute to the crystal stability and compactness and result in a three-dimensional arrangement. The aqua complex PhPO3(SnPh3)2\u00b72H2O has a discrete structure and the anion PhPO32- behaves as a bidentate ligand.",

The Raman scattering intensities of LO ZnS-like and ZnSe-like phonon modes, corresponding to pure S and Se vibrations, respectively, are revealed to be significantly enhanced when excited with 325 nm excitation in the case of S vibrations, and with 455 nm in the case of Se vibrations. This behavior is explained by the interaction of the excitation photons with the corresponding S or Se electronic states in the conduction band, and further confirmed by first principles simulations. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of the coupling between the electronic transitions and photons in the case of Raman resonance effects, and provide inputs for further studies of lattice dynamics, especially in the case of chalcogenide materials. Additionally, the coexistence of modes corresponding to only S vibrations and only Se vibrations in the ZnSSe alloys makes these results applicable for the compositional assessment of ZnSSe compounds.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

In this reaction nbd acts as a sequential acceptor of hydrogen to eventually give norbornane. Complex 2\u2009b is distorted in the solid-state away from square planar. DFT calculations have been used to rationalise this distortion. Addition of H2 to 2\u2009a/b hydrogenates the phosphine\u2013alkene ligand and forms the bisdihydrogen/dihydride complex [Rh(PCyp3)2(H)2(\u03b72-H2)2][BArF4] (5) which has been identified spectroscopically. Addition of the hydrogen acceptor tert-butylethene (tbe) to 5 eventually regenerates 2\u2009a/b, passing through an intermediate which has undergone dehydrogenation of only one PCyp3 ligand, which can be trapped by addition of MeCN to form trans-[Rh{PCyp2(\u03b72-C5H7)}(PCyp3)(NCMe)][BArF4] (6). Dehydrogenation of a PCyp3 ligand also occurs on addition of Na[BArF4] to [RhCl(nbd)(PCyp3)] in presence of arene (benzene, fluorobenzene) to give [Rh(\u03b76-C6H5X){PCyp2(\u03b72-C5H7)}][BArF4] (7: X = F, 8: X = H). The related complex [Rh(nbd){PCyp2(\u03b72-C5H7)}][BArF4] 9 is also reported. Rapid (\u22485 minutes) acceptorless dehydrogenation occurs on treatment of [RhCl(dppe)(PCyp3)] with Na[BArF4] to give [Rh(dppe){PCyp2(\u03b72-C5H7)}][BArF4] (10), which reacts with H2 to afford the dihydride/dihydrogen complex [Rh(dppe)(PCyp3)(H)2(\u03b72-H2)][BArF4] (11). Competition experiments using the new mixed alkyl phosphine ligand PCy2(Cyp) show that [RhCl(nbd){PCy2(Cyp)}] undergoes dehydrogenation exclusively at the cyclopentyl group to give [Rh(\u03b76-C6H5X){PCy2(\u03b72-C5H7)}][BArF4] (17: X = F, 18: X = H). The underlying reasons behind this preference have been probed using DFT calculations. All the complexes have been characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, and for 2\u2009a/b, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 17 also by single crystal X-ray diffraction.",

In order to test the principle that a CA IX inhibitor could be used for targeting PET or SPECT metallic radioisotopes to tumours we have prepared a number of conjugates involving aryl-sulfonamides or an acetazolamide derivative linked to a range of copper, indium, rhenium, 99m-technetium and zinc complexes. Radiolabelled 64Cu and 99mTc analogues of the \u2018cold\u2019 Cu and some of the Re complexes were prepared in good radiochemical incorporation. Inhibition of various human carbonic anhydrase isoforms (I, II, IX and XII) was tested with the \u2018cold\u2019, non-radiolabelled complexes, and compared with an acetazolamide standard (AZA).

The X-ray crystallographic analysis achieved on single crystals obtained by slow evaporation at room temperature revealed the formation of an unexpected supramolecular coordination network. The elementary building block can be viewed as two Me3 Sn moieties linked by a bridging 4-nitrophenylphosphate ligand. The two tin atoms are five-coordinated and describe a trans-Me3 SnO2 geometry in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement. However, the Sn atoms are distinct, exhibiting two different environments. Thus, one is linked to two axial oxygen atoms from two distinct phosphato groups, whereas the other is bound to one phosphato oxygen atom and to a water molecule. From a supramolecular point of view, the combination of the tridentate binding mode of 4-NO2 C6 H4 PO4 and the additional formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between NO2/H2 O and PO4/H2 O groups gives rise to a three-dimensional lattice network.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe heavy use of chemicals for agricultural, industrial and domestic purposes has increased the risk of freshwater contamination worldwide. Consequently, the demand for efficient new analytical tools for on-line and on-site water quality monitoring has become particularly urgent.In this study, a small-scale single chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cell (SCMFC), fabricated by rapid prototyping layer-by-layer 3D printing, was tested as a biosensor for continuous water quality monitoring.When acetate was fed as the rate-limiting substrate, the SCMFC acted as a sensor for chemical oxygen demand (COD) in water. The linear detection range was 3\u2013164\u00a0ppm, with a sensitivity of 0.05\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcA\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0cm\u22122 with respect to the anode total surface area. The response time was as fast as 2.8\u00a0min.At saturating acetate concentrations (COD>164 ppm), the miniature SCMFC could rapidly detect the presence of cadmium in water with high sensitivity (0.2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg\u00a0l\u22121\u00a0cm\u22122) and a lower detection limit of only 1\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg\u00a0l\u22121. The biosensor dynamic range was 1\u201325\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg\u00a0l\u22121. Within this range of concentrations, cadmium affected only temporarily the electroactive biofilm at the anode. When the SCMFCs were again fed with fresh wastewater and no pollutant, the initial steady-state current was recovered within 12\u00a0min.",

    "abstract": "Abstract4-Methyl- and 4-benzyl-5-aminoisoquinolin-1-ones are close analogues of the water-soluble PARP-1 inhibitor 5-AIQ. Their synthesis was approached through Pd-catalysed cyclisations of N-(2-alkenyl)-2-iodo-3-nitrobenzamides. Reaction of N,N-diallyl-2-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide with Pd(PPh3)4 gave a mixture of 2-allyl-4-methyl-5-nitroisoquinolin-1-one and 2-allyl-4-methylene-5-nitro-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1-one. N-Benzhydryl-N-cinnamyl-2-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide similarly gave 2-benzhydryl-4-benzyl-5-nitroisoquinolin-1-one and 2-benzhydryl-4-benzylidene-5-nitro-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1-one. The isomeric products are not interconvertible. A deuterium-labelling study indicated that the isomers were formed by different pathways: a \u00cf\u0080-allyl-Pd route and the classical Heck route. The corresponding secondary amides N-allyl-2-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide and N-((substituted)-cinnamyl)-2-iodo-3-nitrobenzamide gave good yields of the required 4-methyl- and 4-((substituted)-benzyl)-5-nitroisoquinolin-1-ones, respectively, under optimised conditions (Pd(PPh3)4, Et3N, Bu4NCl, 150\u00a0\u00b0C, rapid heating).

    "abstract": "Solid electrolytes that are chemically stable and have a high ionic conductivity would dramatically enhance the safety and operating lifespan of rechargeable lithium batteries. Here, we apply a multi-technique approach to the Li-ion conducting system (1\u2013z)Li4SiO4\u2013(z)Li3PO4 with the aim of developing a solid electrolyte with enhanced ionic conductivity. Previously unidentified superstructure and immiscibility features in high-purity samples are characterized by X-ray and neutron diffraction across a range of compositions (z = 0.0\u20131.0). Ionic conductivities from AC impedance measurements and large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are in good agreement, showing very low values in the parent phases (Li4SiO4 and Li3PO4) but orders of magnitude higher conductivities (10\u20133 S/cm at 573 K) in the mixed compositions. The MD simulations reveal new mechanistic insights into the mixed Si/P compositions in which Li-ion conduction occurs through 3D pathways and a cooperative interstitial mechanism; such correlated motion is a key factor in promoting high ionic conductivity. Solid-state 6Li, 7Li, and 31P NMR experiments reveal enhanced local Li-ion dynamics and atomic disorder in the solid solutions, which are correlated to the ionic diffusivity. These unique insights will be valuable in developing strategies to optimize the ionic conductivity in this system and to identify next-generation solid electrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Two processes are described for improving reaction rates for relatively hydrophobic substrates in aqueous biphasic systems. In the first, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([Octmim]Br) increases the rate of hydroformylation of 1-octene from 8% conversion in 24\u00a0h to full conversion of 1.5\u00a0h. Phase separation is fast and catalyst retention is good. 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide gives little rate enhancement, whilst 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide gives stable emulsions., The mechanism of action of these additives is discussed. In the second approach, functionalising PPh3 with amidine groups allows the rhodium catalysed hydroformylation of 1-octene in toluene with a very high reaction rate. The catalyst can be switched between toluene and water by bubbling CO2 and back into toluene by bubbling N2 at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. This switching has been used to separate the catalyst from hydrophobic (from 1-octene) or hydrophilic (from allyl alcohol) aldehydes obtained from hydroformylation reactions. CO2 expanded liquids have been shown to be effective media for transporting substrates and catalysts over supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts. The advantages offered over all gas phase and liquid phase catalysts are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In multiple time-scale (singularly perturbed) dynamical systems, canards are counterintuitive solutions that evolve along both attracting and repelling invariant manifolds. In two dimensions, canards result in periodic oscillations whose amplitude and period grow in a highly nonlinear way: they are slowly varying with respect to a control parameter, except for an exponentially small range of values where they grow extremely rapidly. This sudden growth, called a canard explosion, has been encountered in many applications ranging from chemistry to neuronal dynamics, aerospace engineering and ecology. Canards were initially studied using nonstandard analysis, and later the same results were proved by standard techniques such as matched asymptotics, invariant manifold theory and parameter blow-up. More recently, canard-like behaviour has been linked to surfaces of discontinuity in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems.",

The N-terminus of the protein contains an octameric repeat region with each of the four repeats containing a histidine. The N-terminus has two additional histidines distal to the repeat region that has been commonly known as the fifth site. While binding of copper by the protein has been extensively studied, the contribution of each histidine to copper binding in the full-length protein has not. Here we used a battery of mutants of the recombinant mouse prion protein to assess copper binding with both isothermal titration calorimetry and cyclic voltammetry. The findings indicate that there is extensive cooperativity between different binding sites in the protein. The two highest-affinity binding events occur at the fifth site and at the octameric repeat region. However, the first binding is that to the octameric repeat region. Subsequent binding events after the two initial binding events have lower affinities within the octameric repeat region.",

    "abstract": " The prion protein is a high-affinity copper binding protein that plays a role in the neurodegenerative prion diseases when it is converted into an altered isoform. The function of the protein remains controversial, but its relationship to its metallochemistry has prompted further investigation. While many researchers continue to use short peptide models for binding studies, the clear discrepancy between data obtained with such models when compared to those of full-length recombinant proteins requires clarification with this more appropriate model. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to assess metal affinity for PrP. Using both full-length native and recombinant prion protein, we have demonstrated that the prion protein binds copper but has little affinity for other metals. Metal binding is highly pH sensitive, being optimal at pH 7.5 for copper, nickel, and zinc and at pH 5.5 for iron. Metal binding affinity for PrP was not altered by protein glycosylation. The use of suitable thermodynamic modeling reveals complex and cooperative copper binding, with evidence of negative cooperativity within the octarepeat region. Cyclic voltammetry was utilized to assess the electrochemistry of copper-charged prion protein, and we show that mPrP has a redox potential of 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 V versus the saturated calomel electrode at pH 7. The analysis also indicated that PrP is able to undergo reversible redox cycling with equal oxidative and reductive charges that are largely dependent on the copper bound to the octarepeat. The fifth site provides a small contribution to this redox activity, but only when the octarepeat is present. These results show conclusively that PrP can utilize copper for electron transfer, which would be expected for a radical detoxifying enzyme, and that the octarepeat region is the functional domain.",

We have used a CuI-catalysed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition click reaction to prepare the 1,2,3-triazole-linked diethynyl-pyridine amides. The G-quadruplex DNA binding properties of the ligands have been examined by using a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The investigated compounds are conformationally flexible, having free rotation around the triple bond, and exhibit enhanced G-quadruplex binding stabilisation and specificity between intramolecular promoter G-quadruplex DNA motifs compared to the first generation of diarylethynyl amides (J. Am. Chem. Soc.2008, 130, 15\u2009950\u201315\u2009956). The ligands show versatility in molecular recognition and promising G-quadruplex discrimination with 2\u201350-fold selectivity exhibited between different intramolecular promoter G-quadruplexes. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic analysis suggested that at higher concentration these ligands disrupt the c-kit2 G-quadruplex structure. The studies validate the design concept of the 1,3-diethynyl-pyridine-based scaffold and demonstrate that these ligands exhibit not only significant selectivity over duplex DNA but also variation in G-quadruplex interaction properties based on small chemical changes in the scaffold, leading to unprecedented differential recognition of different DNA G-quadruplex sequences.",

Their interactions with quadruplexes have been evaluated by means of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular modelling studies. FRET analysis indicates that these ligands exhibit significant selectivity for quadruplex over duplex DNA, and the position of the carboxamide side chains is of paramount importance in G-quadruplex stabilisation. UV/Vis titration studies reveal that bis-indole ligands bind tightly to quadruplexes and show a three- to fivefold preference for c-kit2 over h-telo quadruplex DNA. CD studies revealed that bis-indole carboxamide with a central pyridine ring induces the formation of a single, antiparallel, conformation of the h-telo quadruplex in the presence and absence of added salt. The chirality of h-telo quadruplex was transferred to the achiral ligand (induced CD) and the formation of a preferred atropisomer was observed.",

In this study both phenomena are exploited with a gold\u2013gold micro-trench electrode with ca. 70 \u03bcm width and ca. 800 \u03bcm trench depth. In \u201cgenerator\u2013collector mode\u201d, feedback current enhancement is demonstrated for the hydroquinone/ benzoquinone redox system. Next, a \u201cmodulator-sensor mode\u201d experiment is developed in which one electrode potential is stepped into the negative potential region (employing the normal pulse voltammetry method) to induce an oscillating pH change locally in the micro-trench. The resulting shift in the hydroquinone/ benzoquinone reversible potential causes a Faradaic sensor signal (employing chronoamperometry). This method provides a \u201cchemical filter\u201d by selecting pH-sensitive redox processes only, and by showing enhanced sensitivity in the region of low buffer capacity. The results for the chemically reversible hydroquinone/ benzoquinone system are contrasted to the detection of the chemically irreversible ammonia oxidation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Voltammetric current responses are demonstrated consistent with the processes in the microphase formed at the salt | electrode | gas triple phase boundary. Copper metal electro-deposition is observed. Direct electrochemistry of dioxygen from the gas phase at the salt crystal | gold electrode contact is observed and gas sensing applications are proposed.",

Through employing first-principles density functional theory calculations, we identify a direct structural link between the metastable crystalline and amorphous phases. The phase transition is driven by the displacement of Ge atoms along the rocksalt [111] direction from stable octahedron to high energy unstable tetrahedron sites close to the intrinsic vacancy regions, which generates a high energy intermediate phase between metastable and amorphous phases. Due to the instability of Ge at the tetrahedron sites, the Ge atoms naturally shift away from those sites, giving rise to the formation of local-ordered fourfold motifs and the long-range structural disorder.

    "abstract": "We have performed real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of bismuth crystals that were grown under electrochemical control at low overpotentials to ensure a slow growth rate and allow in situ observation of the growth. A two step chronoamperometric potential was applied to a boron-doped diamond (BDD) working electrode with a short high overpotential, \u22120.4 V (2 s), to nucleate the bismuth, and then a long low overpotential for slow growth, \u22120.32 V (4.4 h). Growth rates of individual crystals and detailed growth mechanisms could be followed in real time because of the slow crystal growth. The close proximity of the AFM tip and tip holder to the working electrode appears to hinder the diffusion of bismuth to the BDD surface, as evidenced by the significantly lower density of crystals under the cantilever as compared to the rest of the electrode, therefore slowing down the growth process.",

    "abstract": "Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) are widely used in technological applications ranging from photovoltaics to thin-film transparent field-effect transistors. In this work we report a first-principles investigation, based on density-functional theory, of the atomic and electronic properties of ${\\text{Ga}}_{2}{\\text{O}}_{3}{(\\text{ZnO})}_{6}$ $({\\text{GZO}}_{6})$, which is a promising candidate to be used as host oxide for wide band gap TCO applications. We identify a low-energy configuration for the coherent distribution of the Ga and Zn atoms in the cation positions within the experimentally reported orthorhombic ${\\text{GZO}}_{6}$ structure. Four Ga atoms are located in four-fold sites, while the remaining 12 Ga atoms in the unit cell form four shared Ga agglomerates (a motif of four atoms). The Zn atoms are distributed in the remaining cation sites with effective coordination numbers from 3.90 to 4.50. Furthermore, we identify the natural formation of twin-boundaries in ${\\text{GZO}}_{6}$, which can explain the zigzag modulations observed experimentally by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in ${\\text{GZO}}_{n}$ $(n=9)$. Due to the intrinsic twin-boundary formation, polarity inversion in the ZnO tetrahedrons is present which is facilitated by the formation of the Ga agglomerates. Our analysis shows that the formation of fourfold Ga sites and Ga agglomerates are stabilized by the electronic octet rule, while the distribution of Ga atoms and the formation of the twin-boundary help alleviate excess strain. Finally we identify that the electronic properties of ${\\text{GZO}}_{6}$ are essentially determined by the electronic properties of ZnO, i.e., there are slight changes in the band gap and optical absorption properties.",

    "abstract": "We employ the quasiharmonic approximation to study the temperature-dependent lattice dynamics of the four different phases of cesium tin iodide $({\\mathrm{CsSnI}}_{3})$. Within this framework, we obtain the temperature dependence of a number of structural properties, including the cell volume, bulk modulus, and Gr\\\"uneisen parameter. The Gibbs free energy of each phase is compared against the temperature-dependent Helmholtz energy obtained from the equilibrium structure within the harmonic approximation. We find that the black tetragonal perovskite phase is not dynamically stable up to at least 500 K, with the phonon dispersion displaying negative optic modes, which pass through all of the high-symmetry wave vectors in the Brillouin zone. The main contributions to the negative modes are found to be motions of the Cs atom inside the perovskite cage. The black cubic perovskite structure shows a zone-boundary instability, indicated by soft modes at the special $\\mathbf{q}$ points $M$ and $R$. These modes are present in calculations at the equilibrium (0 K) lattice constant, while at finite temperature additional negative modes develop at the zone center, indicating a ferroelectric instability. The yellow crystal, composed of one-dimensional $({\\mathrm{SnI}}_{6}){}_{n}$ double chains, has the same heat of formation as the orthorhombic perovskite phase at 0 K, but becomes less energetically favorable at higher temperatures, due to its higher free energy.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of interstitial hydrogen in yttria was studied by means of ab initio calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT) and muonium spin polarization spectroscopy ($\\ensuremath{\\mu}$SR). The density-functional calculations, based on a semilocal functional within the GGA-PBE and a hybrid functional, uncovered multiple geometrical configurations for the neutral, H${}^{0}$, and the negatively charged, H${}^{\\ensuremath{-}}$, states of hydrogen, thus demonstrating the existence of metastable minimum-energy sites. It was observed that the low-energy configurations for H${}^{0}$ and H${}^{\\ensuremath{-}}$ are similar: they prefer to relax in deep, interstitial sites, whereas the equilibrium configurations for the positively charged state, H${}^{+}$, were bond-type configurations with the hydrogen forming a covalent O-H bond with an O anion. For all neutral and negative configurations, localized defect levels were found inside the gap. Overall, the results for the formation energies obtained by the two different functionals are qualitatively similar; an amphoteric behavior was found for hydrogen after considering the lowest-energy structures for each charge state. The calculated acceptor transition level, obtained by the hybrid functional and seen near midgap, is consistent with $\\ensuremath{\\mu}$SR data from literature. The results are consistent with the present $\\ensuremath{\\mu}$SR data, where the observed diamagnetic signal is attributed to a donor-like muonium at the oxygen-bonded configurations and the paramagnetic signal to an acceptor-like deep muonium at the interstitial sites.",

The intrinsic vacancies form ordered planes perpendicular to the stacking direction in both phases, which separate the GST building blocks. The 3Ge-Te-3Sb rule leads to the intermixing of Ge and Sb atoms in the (0001) planes for ${\\text{Ge}}_{3}{\\text{Sb}}_{2}{\\text{Te}}_{6}$ and ${\\text{Ge}}_{2}{\\text{Sb}}_{2}{\\text{Te}}_{5}$, while only single atomic species in the (0001) planes satisfy this rule for the ${\\text{GeSb}}_{2}{\\text{Te}}_{4}$ and ${\\text{GeSb}}_{4}{\\text{Te}}_{7}$ compositions. Furthermore, we explain the volume expansion of the metastable phase with respect to the stable phase as a consequence of the different stacking sequence of the Te atoms in the stable and metastable phases, which leads to a smaller Coulomb repulsion in the stable phase. The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters are in excellent agreement with experimental results and differ by less than 1% from the lattice parameters derived from a combination of the GeTe and ${\\text{Sb}}_{2}{\\text{Te}}_{3}$ parent compounds.",

The concept of direct and nondirect heated electrodes is discussed, and simulation work is evaluated. Microwave-assisted electrochemistry predominantly results in higher current responses (up to 2 magnitudes higher) due to increased temperature and mass transport to the active electrodes. Temperature gradients at microwave-affected electrodes may exceed 105 K/cm, with temperature hotspots found in the thin diffusion layers set up at ultramicroelectrodes. Research into microwave-assisted electroanalysis can lead to enhanced capillary electrophoresis detection, improved stripping voltammetry and development of new high temperature methods.",

In electrochemical experiments the iron phytate films show well-defined voltammetric responses consistent with an immobilised Fe(III/II) redox system in aqueous (LiClO4, NaClO4, KClO4, phosphate buffer) and in ethanolic (LiClO4, NaClO4, NBu4ClO4) electrolyte solutions. The Fe(III/II) redox system is reversible and cation insertion/expulsion occurs fast on the timescale of voltammetric experiments even for more bulky NBu4+ cations and in ethanolic solution. Peak shape analysis and scan rate dependent midpoint potentials suggest structural changes accompanying the redox process and limiting propagation. Iron phytate is proposed as a versatile and essentially colourless cation electro-insertion material and as a potential energy storage material.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMo/MoSe2 thin film electrodes formed by selenisation of molybdenum are investigated as chemically robust substrates for the electro-deposition of InCu precursor layers for CuInSe2 (CISe) solar cell absorber films. Exposure of molybdenum films to selenium vapour at 550\u00a0\u00b0C produces thin and chemically robust heterostructures of Mo/MoSe2. These films exhibit the characteristics of a degenerate semi-conductor and provide close to metallic electrical conductivity for electro-deposition processes in both acidic and alkaline aqueous media. The Mo/MoSe2 films are characterised by cyclic voltammetry for the reduction of Ru(NH3)63+ in aqueous 0.1\u00a0M KCl, for the reduction of 0.1\u00a0M In3+ in aqueous 0.5\u00a0M LiCl pH 3, and for the reduction of 0.1\u00a0M Cu2+ in aqueous 3\u00a0M NaOH with 0.2\u00a0M d-sorbitol. In all three cases well-defined and reversible voltammetric responses are observed. For the formation of CISe films initially In3+ is deposited potentiostatically followed by electro-deposition of Cu2+ and selenisation at 550\u00a0\u00b0C in selenium vapour. Mechanically stable CISe films are produced and preliminary photo-electrochemical data demonstrate the effects of changing the stoichiometry.",

Selenisation at ca. 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min in selenium vapour gives CuInSe2 (or CISe). Mapping using the photo-electrochemical reduction of Eu(NO3)3 is used to asses the relative photoactivity as a function of position and surface treatment.Etching of detrimental CuxSe phases is investigated with 5% and 0.5% (w/w) aqueous KCN. The slower 0.5% (w/w) KCN etch allows better process control, and re-annealing at 500\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min followed by further etching significantly improved the photo-activity. However, over the large area local pinhole recombination effects are substantial. An alternative low temperature film optimisation method is proposed based on (i) KCN over-etch, (ii) hypochlorite (5%, w/w) pinhole removal (Mo etch), and (iii) a final KCN etch to give good and more uniform activity.",

Calculations were used to characterize the diverse isomers and assign their IR spectra; non-adiabatic dynamics was simulated to understand their photo-deactivation mechanism. The most stable dimers, tt-1 and tt-2, were obtained by trans\u2013trans aggregation (N\u2013H\u22efOC interactions) and could be identified in the matrix. The main products formed after irradiation are the trans\u2013cis dimers (tc-3 and tc-4), also stabilized by N\u2013H\u22efOC interactions. In contrast to the photochemistry of the monomers, no dissociative products were observed after 248 nm irradiation of the dimers. The absence of dissociative products can be explained by a proton-transfer mechanism in the excited state that is faster than the photo-dissociative mechanism. The fact that hydrogen bonding has such a significant effect on the photochemical stability of NMF has important implications to understand the stability of peptide-bonded systems to UV irradiation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " The \u03b2-diketiminate-stabilized calcium amide complex [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)] (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and magnesium methyl complex [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Mg(Me)(THF)] are reported as efficient precatalysts for hydroamination/cyclization of aminoalkenes. The reactions proceeded under mild conditions, allowing the synthesis of five-, six-, and seven-membered heterocyclic compounds. Qualitative assessment of these reactions revealed that the ease of catalytic turnover increases (i) for smaller ring sizes (5 > 6 > 7), (ii) substrates that benefit from favorable Thorpe\u2212Ingold effects, and (iii) substrates that do not possess additional substitution on the alkene entity. Prochiral substrates may undergo diastereoselective hydroamination/cyclization depending upon the position of the existing stereocenter. Furthermore, a number of minor byproducts of these reactions, arising from competitive alkene isomerization reactions, were identified. A series of stoichiometric reactions between the precatalysts and primary amines provided an important model for catalyst initiation and suggested that these reactions are facile at room temperature, with the reaction of the calcium precatalyst with benzylamine proceeding with \u0394G\u00b0(298 K) = \u22122.7 kcal mol\u22121. Both external amine/amide exchange and coordinated amine/amide exchange were observed in model complexes, and the data suggest that these processes occur via low-activation-energy pathways. As a result of the formation of potentially reactive byproducts such as hexamethyldisilazane, calcium-catalyst initiation is reversible, whereas for the magnesium precatalyst, this process is nonreversible. Further stoichiometric reactions of the two precatalysts with 1-amino-2,2-diphenyl-4-pentene demonstrated that the alkene insertion step proceeds via a highly reactive transient alkylmetal intermediate that readily reacts with N\u2212H \u03c3 bonds under catalytically relevant conditions. The results of deuterium-labeling studies are consistent with the formation of a single transient alkyl complex for both the magnesium and calcium precatalysts. Kinetic analysis of the nonreversible magnesium system revealed that the reaction rate depends directly upon catalyst concentration and inversely upon substrate concentration, suggesting that substrate-inhibited alkene insertion is rate-determining.",

    "abstract": "Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of organic moieties. We evaluate the ionization potentials of the (010) surface termination of BiVO4 using first-principles simulations. The electron removal energy of the pristine termination (7.2 eV) validates recent experimental reports. The effect of water absorption on the ionization potentials is considered using static models as well as structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Owing to the large molecular dipole of H2O, adsorption stabilizes the valence band edge (downward band bending), thereby increasing the ionization potentials. These results provide new understanding to the role of polar layers on complex oxide semiconductors, with importance for the design of efficient photoelectrodes for water splitting.Keywords:  theoretical electrochemistry; metal oxides; solid\u2212liquid interface; density functional theory",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the effect of surfaces on the adsorption and transport of CO2 with faujasite (FAU) using molecular dynamics. We modeled the {111}, {011}, and {100} surfaces of FAU. The {011} and {100} surfaces have incomplete sodalite cages, which adsorb CO2 more favorably than the most stable {111} surface where the sodalite cages are intact. The surfaces of siliceous, sodium, and potassium FAU were modeled to compare the effect of zeolite composition. The results show that CO2 diffusion through the surface is intermediate between diffusion in the zeolite and in bulk CO2 above the surface. In siliceous FAU the diffusion of bulk CO2 is reduced by 42% in the surface region and 61% in the zeolite. CO2 diffusion is reduced by up to 83% inside aluminosilicate zeolites compared to siliceous. However, the surface adsorption of CO2 is more affected by the surface structure than the composition, and at the surface there are dense layers of adsorbed CO2 indicating sites of enhanced adsorption with reduced diffusion across them, particularly associated with the incomplete sodalite cages. Thus, we suggest that spherical particles with these surface sites are likely to be more effective sorbents than {111} faceted particles.",

    "abstract": "Flow into and around the olfactory chamber of a fish determines how odorant from the fish's immediate environment is transported to the sensory surface (olfactory epithelium) lining the chamber. Diffusion times in water are long, even over comparatively short distances (millimetres). Therefore, transport from the external environment to the olfactory epithelium must be controlled by processes that rely on convection (i.e. the bulk flow of fluid). These include the beating of cilia lining the olfactory chamber and the relatively inexpensive pumping action of accessory sacs. Flow through the chamber may also be induced by an external flow. Flow over the olfactory epithelium appears to be laminar. Odorant transfer to the olfactory epithelium may be facilitated in several ways: if the olfactory organs are mounted on stalks that penetrate the boundary layer; by the steep velocity gradients generated by beating cilia; by devices that deflect flow into the olfactory chamber; by parallel arrays of olfactory lamellae; by mechanical agitation of the chamber (or olfactory stalks); and by vortices. Overall, however, our knowledge of the hydrodynamics of fish olfaction is far from complete. Several areas of future research are outlined.",

    "abstract": "The sensory channels in the olfactory organs of modern sharks and rays (neoselachians) are lined with fields of non-sensory cilia. Using evidence from 31 species of neoselachian, this review attempts to identify the fluid \u2013 water or mucus \u2013 propelled by these cilia. The apparently common structure of the olfactory epithelium in these 31 diverse species implies that the cilia perform the same function and that this function is therefore independent of neoselachian phylogeny, lifestyle, gross nasal anatomy and the principal means by which water is circulated through the single major olfactory channel. On balance, the evidence suggests that the cilia propel mucus. This evidence includes short cilia, the presence (or absence) of water currents in the nasal region, mucociliary interactions, poor ciliary alignment, rare or absent interciliary connections, deep ciliary anchorages and the observation of cilia performing effective strokes. The short cilia are particularly telling. Goblet cells within and on the edge of the sensory epithelium are likely to be the source of any mucus layer. If the cilia of the neoselachian olfactory epithelium do propel mucus, there are three crucial implications. First, given that ciliary function is potentially independent of neoselachian phylogeny, it is possible that cilia in all neoselachians propel mucus. Second, a large part of the neoselachian olfactory organ must be actively involved in protecting the sensory epithelium from damage. Third, flow of water through the sensory channels must be driven by flow of water through the major olfactory channel.",

The electrodes were used to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the dark and under illumination using in situ potential-modulated absorption spectroscopy (PMAS) and light-modulated absorption spectroscopy (LMAS) combined with impedance spectroscopy. Formation of surface-bound higher-valent iron species (or \u201csurface trapped holes\u201d) was deduced from the PMAS spectra measured in the OER onset region. Similar LMAS spectra were obtained at more negative potentials in the onset region of photoelectrochemical OER, indicating involvement of the same intermediates. The impedance response of the mesoporous \u03b1-Fe2O3 electrodes exhibits characteristic transmission line behavior that is attributed to slow hopping of holes, probably between surface iron species. Frequency-resolved PMAS and LMAS measurements revealed slow relaxation behavior that can be related to the impedance response and that indicates that the lifetime of the intermediates (or trapped holes) involved in the OER is remarkably long.",

Motion is controlled by the size of the catenane rings and the arrangement of the electron-deficient and electron-rich aromatic units.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The discovery through dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) of a new generation of donor\u2212acceptor [2]catenanes highlights the power of DCC to access unprecedented structures. While conventional thinking has limited the scope of donor\u2212acceptor catenanes to strictly alternating stacks of donor (D) and acceptor (A) aromatic units, DCC is demonstrated in this paper to give access to unusual DAAD, DADD, and ADAA stacks. Each of these catenanes has specific structural requirements, allowing control of their formation. On the basis of these results, and on the observation that the catenanes represent kinetic bottlenecks in the reaction pathway, we propose a mechanism that explains and predicts the structures formed. Furthermore, the spontaneous assembly of catenanes in aqueous dynamic systems gives a fundamental insight into the role played by hydrophobic effect and donor\u2212acceptor interactions when building such complex architectures.",

All compounds are notably sensitive to air and moisture. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 7\u201310 have been structurally characterized, and all are dimeric, with the general formula [M(NMe2)2(\u03bc-NSiR3)]2, in which the \u03bc2-NSiR3 groups bridges two four-coordinate metal centers. The hafnium compound 3 possesses the same basic dimeric structure but shows additional incorporation of liberated HNMe2 bonded to one metal. Compounds 11 and 12 are also both dimeric but also incorporate additional \u03bc2-NMe2 groups, which bridge Si and either Zr or Hf metal centers in the solid state. The Zr and Hf metal centers are both five-coordinated in these species. Aerosol-assisted CVD (AA-CVD) using 4\u20137 and 9\u201312 as precursors generates amorphous films containing M, N, Si, C, and O; the films are dominated by MO2 with smaller contributions from MN, MC and MSiON based on XPS binding energies.",

However most of the presented electrode materials cannot provide the efficiency required for these applications, and/or they are based on economically unfavourable noble metals. In this article, multi-layer electrodes of high conductivity PEDOT prepared by vacuum vapour phase polymerization in the presence of a PEG\u2013PPG\u2013PEG triblock copolymer are used to fabricate a metal-free oxygen reduction electrode. After optimizing the main production parameters, measuring ORR performance of the metal-free PEDOT based electrodes confirms that they have the ability to deliver a stable electrocatalytic activity. A chemical treatment is also used for further enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of these electrodes. Depending on pH, the electrocatalytic activity of these treated electrodes reaches a higher or the same level as platinum based electrodes.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The complexes have been studied viasingle crystal X-ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, it has been observed that the alcohol only adds to one of the imine moieties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also been employed to rationalise the observed structures.

We have studied the effect of surfactant head-group structure and counterion on the self-assembly processes occurring in aqueous mixtures of the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) and the cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Surface tension and conductometric methods were employed, as well as X-ray scattering and reflectometry techniques. The results indicate that the phase behaviour of PEI:cationic surfactant mixtures under dilute conditions can be tuned by altering head-group and counterion. The surfactant head-group exerts a greater influence overall, especially over micellization, since the counterion effect is screened at high polymer concentrations. Also, the self-assembly processes occurring at lower surfactant concentrations are not significantly affected by the counterion effect. The variation of surface tension with surfactant concentration shows a particular \u2018well-like\u2019 profile with a distinct break-point that can be directly related to the onset of film formation. Phase diagrams constructed using surface tension, conductivity and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) data show three different regions where initial interactions, film formation and micellization take place, respectively, characterized by the two main self-assembly boundaries. Based on these results, we propose a molecular interpretation of the aggregation and film formation processes occurring in PEI:cationic surfactant mixtures under increasing surfactant concentrations within the dilute regime.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractDilute mixtures of the water soluble polymer polyethyleneimine (PEI) and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) form mesostructured thin films at the air/solution interface. In this paper we show that these films form spontaneously, reaching an equilibrium composition. When the film is removed, a new solid film rapidly reforms, with a similar morphology when inspected by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM). Successive removal of films lead to a series of structurally similar films, until the amount of surfactant in solution approaches the lower limit of film forming concentration. The results obtained using surfactant-selective potentiometry suggest that the incipient polymer:surfactant aggregates are in a position to migrate to the surface rapidly after film removal, prior to mesostructure formation. X-ray reflectivity indicates that films formed at different PEI:CTAB compositions retain mesophase regular structures with the same d-spacing feature, equal to 52.2\u00a0\u00c5. Grazing incidence diffraction measurements indicate that films are composed of small crystallites arranged in a random powder fashion, developing a rough surface morphology evidenced by BAM. The central finding is that PEI:CTAB films form when the amount of CTAB in solution is higher than a critical film formation concentration, very close to the critical aggregation concentration (CAC), allowing the formation of several equilibrated films from the same growing solution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCuSbS2 and Cu3BiS3 are being investigated as part of a search for new absorber materials for photovoltaic devices. Thin films of these chalcogenides were produced by conversion of stacked and co-electroplated metal precursor layers in the presence of elemental sulfur vapour. Ex-situ XRD and SEM/EDS analyses of the processed samples were employed to study the reaction sequence with the aim of achieving compact layer morphologies. A new \u201cTime-Temperature-Reaction\u201d (TTR) diagram and modified Pilling\u2013Bedworth coefficients have been introduced for the description and interpretation of the reaction kinetics. For equal processing times, the minimum temperature required for CuSbS2 to appear is substantially lower than for Cu3BiS3, suggesting that interdiffusion across the interfaces between the binary sulfides is a key step in the formation of the ternary compounds. The effects of the heating rate and sulfur partial pressure on the phase evolution as well as the potential losses of Sb and Bi during the processes have been investigated experimentally and the results related to the equilibrium pressure diagrams obtained via thermochemical computation.",

The intermediacy of [(6-MesDAC)Cu(OH)] in this reaction was supported by the generation of Cu2O as an additional product. Attempts to generate an isolable copper hydride complex of the type [(6-MesDAC)CuH] by reaction of 1 with Et3SiH resulted instead in migratory insertion to generate [(6-MesDAC-H)Cu(P(p-tolyl)3)] (9) upon trapping by P(p-tolyl)3. Migratory insertion was also observed during attempts to prepare [(6-Mes)CuH], with [(6-Mes-H)Cu(6-Mes)] (10) isolated, following a reaction that was significantly slower than in the 6-MesDAC case. The longer lifetime of [(6-Mes)CuH] allowed it to be trapped stoichiometrically by alkyne, and also employed in the catalytic semi-reduction of alkynes and hydrosilylation of ketones.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDue to the availability and low cost of the elements, the ternary Cu\u2013Sb\u2013S and Cu\u2013Sb\u2013Se semiconductor systems are being studied as sustainable alternative absorber materials to replace CuIn(Ga)(S,Se)2 in thin film photovoltaic applications.Simple evaporation of the metal precursors followed by annealing in a chalcogen environment has been employed in order to test the feasibility of converting stacked metallic layers into the desired compounds. Other samples have been produced from aqueous solutions by electrochemical methods that may be suitable for scale-up.It was found that the minimum temperature required for the complete conversion of the precursors into the ternary chalcogen is 350\u00a0\u00b0C, while binary phase separation occurs at lower temperatures.The new materials have been characterised by structural, electrical and photoelectrochemical techniques in order to establish their potential as absorber layer materials for photovoltaic applications. The photoactive films consisting of CuSbS2 and CuSbSe2 exhibit band-gap energies of ~\u00a01.5\u00a0eV and ~\u00a01.2\u00a0eV respectively, fulfilling the Shockley\u2013Queisser requirements for the efficient harvesting of the solar spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Voltammetric responses of pentoxyresorufin in 4-(3-phenylpropyl)-pyridine (PPP) microdroplets immersed in aqueous electrolyte are investigated in the absence and in the presence of light. The reduction of pentoxyresorufin to leuco-pentoxyresorufin in the dark is shown to occur in a two-electron, two-proton process sensitive to the aqueous pH and the PPP|aqueous electrolyte interfacial tension. No significant net photoelectrochemical current responses are observed, although transient responses indicative of distinct electron and hole charge carriers are seen in the presence of pentoxyresorufin. EPR evidence confirms the formation of radical intermediates upon illumination. As a coreactant, duroquinone in the PPP microdroplet phase is investigated and also shown to undergo two-electron, two-proton reduction (to duroquinol) without significant photoelectrochemical activity. When investigated in combination, pentoxyresorufin acts as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of duroquinol to duroquinone. Wavelength-resolved photovoltammetry experiments clearly implicate pentoxyresorufin as the primary photoexcited intermediate. The photoelectrochemical mechanism is explained on the basis of the presence of a long-lived (possibly charge-separated) photoexcited intermediate in the PPP microphase. Implications for light-energy harvesting are discussed.",

    "abstract": " The bis-guanidino compound H2C{hpp}2 (I; hppH = 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine) has been converted to the monocation [I-H]+ and isolated as the chloride and tetraphenylborate salts. Solution-state spectroscopic data do not differentiate the protonated guanidinium from the neutral guanidino group but suggest intramolecular \u201c\u2014N\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N\u2550\u201d hydrogen bonding to form an eight-membered C3N4H heterocycle. Solid-state CPMAS 15N NMR spectroscopy confirms protonation at one of the imine nitrogens, although line broadening is consistent with solid-state proton transfer between guanidine functionalities. X-ray diffraction data have been recorded over the temperature range 50\u2212273 K. Examination of the carbon\u2212nitrogen bond lengths suggests a degree of \u201cpartial protonation\u201d of the neutral guanidino group at higher temperatures, with greater localization of the proton at one nitrogen position as the temperature is lowered. Difference electron density maps generated from high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies at 110 K give the first direct experimental evidence for proton transfer in a poly(guanidino) system. Computational analysis of I and its conjugate acid [I-H]+ indicate strong cationic resonance stabilization of the guanidinium group, with the nonprotonated group also stabilized, albeit to a lesser extent. The maximum barrier to proton transfer calculated using the Boese\u2212Martin for kinetics method was 2.8 kcal mol\u22121, with hydrogen-bond compression evident in the transition state; addition of zero-point vibrational energy values leads to the conclusion that the proton transfer is barrierless, implying that the proton shuttles freely between the two nitrogen atoms. Calculations determining the gas-phase proton affinity and the pKa in acetonitrile both indicate that compound I should behave as a superbase. This has been confirmed by spectrophotometric titrations in MeCN using polyphosphazene references, which give an average pKa of 28.98 \u00b1 0.05. Triadic analysis indicates that the dominant term causing the high basicity is the relaxation energy.",

Microdroplets of the water-immiscible 3-(4-phenylpropyl)-pyridine (PPP) containing rhodamine B are deposited onto a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode surface which is then immersed into an aqueous solution containing 0.5\u2009M phosphate buffer solution (pH 12). In cyclic voltammetry experiments, it is shown that dark reduction of rhodamine B to leuco-rhodamine B in PPP occurs in two steps\u2014both one electron processes\u2014and the re-oxidation occurs in a single two-electron process. Voltammetric signals are consistent with Na+ transfer (for the first reduction step) and proton transfer (for the second reduction step) coupled to the electron transfer. A proton-driven disproportionation reaction (with kdis=3 mol\u22121\u2009dm3\u2009s\u22121 at pH 12) is observed for the one-electron reduced intermediate. In the presence of light, a new photocatalysed oxidation process for the two-electron conversion of leuco-rhodamine B to rhodamine B is observed. Photoexcitation of rhodamine B is shown to trigger an effective photo-comproportionation mechanism. Quantitative insights into the dark and photomechanisms are obtained by comparison of rhodamine B and rhodamine B octadecylester and by applying an approximate numerical simulation procedure based on DigiSim.",

These highly homologous proteins possess characteristics common amongst antimicrobial peptides and proteins, that is, cationic charge, amphiphilicity and hydrophobicity. Both \u03b11- and \u03b12-Pth possess the same net charge, but differ in relative hydrophobicity as determined by C18 reversed phase HPLC. Brewster angle microscopy, X-ray and neutron reflectometry, external reflection FTIR and associated surface pressure measurements demonstrated that \u03b11 and \u03b12-Pth interact strongly with condensed phase 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (DPPG) monolayers at the air/liquid interface. Both thionins disrupted the in-plane structure of the anionic phospholipid monolayers, removing lipid during this process and both penetrated the lipid monolayer in addition to adsorbing as a single protein layer to the lipid head-group. However, analysis of the interfacial structures revealed that the \u03b12-Pth showed faster disruption of the lipid film and removed more phospholipid (12%) from the interface than \u03b11-Pth. Correlating the protein properties and lipid binding activity suggests that hydrophobicity plays a key role in the membrane lipid removal activity of thionins.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Here we investigate the defect, surface and lithium migration properties of the Li2M(SO4)2 (M = Fe, Mn, Co) materials using combined atomistic modelling and density functional theory (DFT) techniques. All intrinsic defect types including Li/M antisite disorder are found to be of high energy, suggesting insignificant concentrations. Low activation energies are found for lithium migration along the a-axis channels giving rise to long-range 1D diffusion, which are supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the crystal morphology a significant surface area is exposed to these 1D diffusion channels, which would allow facile Li insertion and extraction. Using DFT simulations we reproduce the high voltage of the Li2Fe(SO4)2 material in accord with electrochemical data and also examine local structural distortions on lithium extraction.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Recently, the pyrophosphate family of cathodes has attracted considerable attention, particularly Li2FeP2O7 related to its high operating voltage and enhanced safety properties; in addition the sodium-based pyrophosphates Na2FeP2O7 and Na2MnP2O7 are also generating interest. Herein, we present defect chemistry and ion migration results, determined via atomistic simulation techniques, for Na2MP2O7 (where M = Fe, Mn) as well as findings for Li2FeP2O7 for direct comparison. Within the pyrophosphate framework the most favourable intrinsic defect type is found to be the antisite defect, in which alkali-cations (Na/Li) and M ions exchange positions. Low activation energies are found for long-range diffusion in all crystallographic directions in Na2MP2O7 suggesting three-dimensional (3D) Na-ion diffusion. In contrast Li2FeP2O7 supports 2D Li-ion diffusion. The 2D or 3D nature of the alkali-ion migration pathways within these pyrophosphate materials means that antisite defects are much less likely to impede their transport properties, and hence important for high rate performance.\r      \r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The bridged tricyclic core of the cladiellins has been constructed via three ring-forming reactions: (i) an intramolecular reductive cyclization between an aldehyde and an unsaturated ester, mediated by samarium(II) iodide, to form a tetrahydropyranol; (ii) reaction of a metal carbenoid, generated from a diazo ketone, with an ether to produce an ylide-like intermediate that rearranges to produce E- or Z-oxabicyclo[6.2.1]-5-undecen-9-one; and (iii) a Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition reaction to construct the third ring found in the core structure of the cladiellins. The key ring-forming reaction, in which a diazo ketone is converted into a bridged bicyclic ether, can be tuned to give either of the isomeric oxabicyclo[6.2.1]-5-undecen-9-ones as the major product by switching from a copper to a rhodium catalyst and selecting the appropriate reaction conditions. The tricyclic products obtained from the three-step sequence involving the Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition reaction can be employed as advanced intermediates to prepare a wide range of cladiellin natural products.",

When the temperature was further increased to 165 \u00b0C, all complexes demonstrated a far higher activity irrespective of the identity of the metal or number of labile initiator groups.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe term biodiesel refers to the Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters (FAAE) derived from vegetable, animal or waste oil feedstocks. This alternative fuel is increasingly becoming a significant part of the transport sector with over 10 million tonnes sold in the EU in 2007. Currently a small amount of biodiesel (presently 3.5% in the UK) is present in diesel fuel but this could rise to up to 30% in the medium term. As biodiesel is not one chemical compound but an amalgamation of different FAAE, the physical properties of the diesel fuel are not only dependent on the amount of biodiesel in the diesel fuel (blend level) but also on the fatty acid profile of the biodiesel. In this paper we report on an initial study to assess a range of current techniques which could be used in the future as a basis to determine blend level in unknown samples of diesel and gain further information on the fatty acid profile of the biodiesel in the blend. The three techniques applied were FT-IR spectroscopy, refractive index and UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBiodiesel is the fatty acid alkyl esters produced by the transesterification of vegetable, animal or microbial lipids. After ethanol, it accounts for the largest proportion of global biofuel production. Yet, due to the level of polyunsaturation, biodiesel is also oxidatively unstable. When biodiesel oxidises the viscosity increases, which leads to reduced fuel performance and in extreme cases can lead to engine failure. To aid in understanding the process of this degradation a specialist NMR tube rig was designed to assess the oxidation of biodiesel. The NMR tube rig allowed the in situ1H NMR measurement of the sample while air was bubbled through at fixed intervals. The methyl esters of linolenic acid (18:3), linoleic acid (18:2) and oleic acid (18:1) were oxidised at 110\u00a0\u00b0C over a 24\u00a0h period. The decomposition of biodiesel is complex, and there is more than one mechanism involved in the degradation. Using this rig the onset of oxidation for 18:3 and 18:2 was found to be almost instantaneous. The rate of oxidation was found to be slightly less for 18:2 than 18:3 while the maximum rate was observed for 18:3 from the beginning of the oxidation, this was only observed after 280\u00a0min for 18:2. The oxidation of 18:1 started at approximately 500\u00a0min and, slowly degraded during the remaining reaction time. The formation of a number of secondary oxidation products such as aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and formates were also quantified.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this investigation ozonolysis in the presence of ethanol was used to depolymerise lignin, resulting in a low conversion of oxygenated aromatics over short reaction times, or a range of saturated esters over 24\u00a0h. Short chain oxygenates can be used as fuel additives, displacing a percentage of a hydrocarbon fuel while leading to improvement in some of the fuel properties. The utility of the resulting bio-oils was therefore assessed by blending with a range of fuels. Guaiacol, a potential antioxidant, was formed over short reaction times and was found to be completely miscible with low-sulphur petrol (ULSP), diesel, aviation kerosene and rapeseed methyl ester. The mainly aliphatic proportion of the bio-oil produced over 24\u00a0h could be blended with the fuels replacing a maximum of 12\u201317\u00a0wt.% of the hydrocarbon fuel.",

The fatty acid profile of biodiesel differs depending upon the feedstock of the derived fuel and is the major factor in determining the properties of the fuel. Using biodiesel blends decreases hydrocarbon, particulate matter, and CO emissions while increasing fuel consumption and NOx emissions. This effect is dependent upon not only the blend ratio but also the fatty acid profile of the biodiesel. Current techniques to determine the fatty acid profile of biodiesel samples are both time-consuming and expensive; however, by measurement of three simple physical properties (viscosity, density, and the refractive index) and a comparison of the values to known standards, it is possible to create a model that can accurately predict both the average chain length and degree of unsaturation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBiodiesel is a renewable fuel synthesised from plant, waste or algal oils. Though biodiesel can be used as a replacement for diesel fuel, a number of technical issues, including the reduced oxidative stability, limit the application. This research article compares various analytical techniques which can be used to assess the oxidation of biodiesel and, through comparison, elucidate further the products and mechanism of degradation. Rapeseed methyl ester (RME) was oxidised at both 90\u00a0\u00b0C and 150\u00a0\u00b0C, aliquots of both the solution and the volatiles were taken and analysed using UV\u2013VIS spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, GC\u2013MS, 1-H and 13-C NMR experiments. The viscosity and the refractive index of the samples were also recorded. Though NMR and GC\u2013MS offer excellent methods to assess the oxidation both require lengthy sample preparation. In contrast in situ FT-IR requires less sample preparation and as such, would be a useful tool for use as an oxidation sensor.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA new method for the determination of the spatial distribution of metal surface area within bimodal micro-/mesoporous solids has been developed. This novel technique involves incorporating a nonane pre-adsorption stage between two successive chemisorption experiments. This method has been used to probe the distribution of platinum amongst the micropores and mesopores of a range of bi-functional PtH-MFI catalysts, each possessing differing surface acidities, which have been used for benzene alkylation with ethane. It has been found that the catalyst with the lowest Si/Al ratio, and thus highest number of acid sites, also possessed the largest metal surface area within its microporosity. This catalyst was also the one that deactivated most rapidly, with coke being deposited predominantly within the micropore network. This was attributed to the bi-functional mechanism for coke formation at higher temperatures. Pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR has also been used to show that a combination of higher mesopore platinum concentration and higher mass transport rates facilitated greater coke deposition within the mesoporosity.",

    "abstract": " The gas-phase (electron diffraction) and solid-state (X-ray) structures of W(NBut)2(NHBut)2 (1) have been determined. In the gas phase, 1 adopts both C1 and C2 conformations in a 69:31 ratio. The solid-state structure is disordered over two equal sites, both showing approximate C2 conformation as in the gas phase; the imido and amido centers are, however, clearly distinguished. Compound 1 has been used to synthesize novel heterobimetallic derivatives W(NBut)4[Rh(COD)]2 (3) and W(NBut)4[Pd(\u03b73-C3H5)]2 (4) via the dilithiated intermediate Li2[W(NBut)4] (2). In both cases, the [W(NBut)4] moiety bridges the two organometallic fragments. Reaction of 1 with Me2Zn has produced [Me(tBuN)W(\u03bc-NBut)2ZnMe(NH2But)] (5). The structures of 3, 4, and 5 have been determined. Thermal decomposition of 4 under an autogenerated pressure at 700 \u00b0C has formed the hitherto uncharacterized bimetallic alloy WPd2.",

In solution, both \u039b and \u0394 isomers were observed, suggesting a low degree of chiral induction from the ligand. One ligand (R-4H) and three complexes [\u0394-(R,R-2)2Ti(OiPr)2, \u039b-(R,R-1)2Zr(OiPr)2 and \u0394-(R,R-3)2Zr(OiPr)2] have also been characterised by single crystal X-ray diffraction.

The titanium complexes are inactive in solution and afford atactic polylactide in the melt. Zr(IV) complexes afford heterotactically enriched polylactide both in toluene solution (at 20 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C) and in the melt. Polymerisations were generally found to be well-controlled, giving predictable molecular weights and low molecular weight distributions. Ligand variation (substituents and/or chirality) has little effect on either the activity or selectivity of initiators.

The [Pd(NH3)4]2+ ion is synthesized with gentle heating in aqueous ammonia solution without formation of Pd(OH)x complex intermediates. The adsorbed [Pd(NH3)4]2+ on the surface of carbon (Vulcan XC-72) is reduced in situ to Pd nanoparticles by NaBH4. The Pd/C catalyst obtained is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that highly dispersed Pd/C catalyst with 20\u00a0wt.% Pd content and with an average Pd nanoparticle diameter of 4.3\u20134.7\u00a0nm could be obtained. The electrochemical measurements show that the Pd/C catalyst without stabilizer has a higher electro-oxidation activity for formic acid compared to that of a Pd/C catalyst prepared in a traditional high temperature polyol process in ethylene glycol.",

All the compounds share common structural features which are identical to the analogous molybdenum species, with four edge-sharing octahedra situated in the same plane, and incorporating two \u00ce\u00bc3-bridging and four \u00ce\u00bc2-bridging methoxide groups. The divalent metal M and tungsten have both octahedral coordination environments with six oxygen atoms. The structure of Na[Zn(acac)3] (6), a by-product of a failed synthesis of 4, is also reported, and is a linear polymer in which [Zn(acac)3]\u2212 anions use all six oxygen atoms to link sodium cations either side of the anion.Thermal decomposition of representative samples (1, 3) shows them to be single-source precursors for metal tungstates MWO4. When the decomposition is carried out under an autogenerated pressure (RAPET) at 700\u00a0\u00b0C 1 forms CoWO4 nanoparticles, along with WOx-filled carbon nanotubes and amorphous carbon, while 3 forms MgWO4 nanoparticles and rods, though the latter lack a carbon shell and are much shorter in length.",

    "abstract": "Sequential cation cross-substitution in zinc-blende chalcogenide semiconductors, from binary to ternary to quaternary compounds, is systematically studied using first-principles electronic structure calculations. Several universal trends are found for the ternary and two classes of quaternary chalcogenides, for example, the lowest-energy structure always has larger lattice constant $a$, smaller tetragonal distortion parameter $\\ensuremath{\\eta}=c/2a$, negative crystal-field splitting at the top of the valence band, and larger band gap compared to the metastable structures for common-row cation substitution. The band structure changes in the cation substitution are analyzed in terms of the band offsets and band character decomposition, showing that although the band gap decreases from binary II-VI to ternary ${\\text{I-III-VI}}_{2}$ are mostly due to the $p\\ensuremath{-}d$ repulsion in the valence band, the decreases from ternary ${\\text{I-III-VI}}_{2}$ to quaternary ${\\text{I}}_{2}{\\text{-II-IV-VI}}_{4}$ chalcogenides are due to the downshift in the conduction band caused by the wave-function localization on the group IV cation site. We propose that common-row-cation ${\\text{I}}_{2}{\\text{-II-IV-VI}}_{4}$ compounds are more stable in the kesterite structure, whereas the widely assumed stannite structure reported in the literature for experimental samples is most likely due to partial disorder in the I-II (001) layer of the kesterite phase.",

A carbon nanoparticle\u2013chitosan host film deposited onto a carbon substrate electrode has been employed to immobilize PdCl2 as catalyst precursor. A one-step electrochemical reduction process gave Pd nanoparticles within the chitosan matrix with different levels of loading, on different carbon substrates, and with a reproducible catalyst particle diameter of ca. 3\u20135\u00a0nm. High activity for formic acid oxidation has been observed in aqueous phosphate buffer medium. The oxidation of formic acid has been investigated as a function of pH and maximum catalyst activity was observed at pH 6. When varying the formic acid concentration, limiting behaviour consistent with a \u201cresistance effect\u201d has been observed. A flow cell system based on a screen-printed carbon electrode has been employed to establish the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the formic acid oxidation. Both increasing the convective-diffusion mass transport rate and increasing the concentration of formic acid caused the oxidation peak current to converge towards the same \u201cresistance limit\u201d. A mechanistic model to explain the resistance effect based on CO2 flux and localized CO2 gas bubble formation at the Pd nanoparticle modified carbon nanoparticle\u2013chitosan host film has been proposed.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims at reducing the shifting distortion of histogram shifting reversible data hiding method. Instead of calculating symmetrically the prediction value as were done in other schemes, based on the gradient-adjusted predictor (GAP), a directed-prediction scheme, which includes two asymmetric predictors-the right and left GAPs, is designed to predict asymmetrically pixel value. Then two asymmetric error histograms, with right and left-skewness, are constructed by gathering the directed prediction errors, which effectively reduces the amount of pixels on the shifted side of the error histograms. Moreover, the optimal embedding points and thresholds are calculated by defining an evaluation index of the shifting distortion. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate that it outperforms several previous methods in terms of payload and image quality.",

Literature reports exist for the stannite and kesterite mineral structures, which are zinc-blende-derived structures, and wurtzite-stannite, which is a wurtzite-derived structure. In this paper, through a global search based on the valence octet rule (local charge neutrality), we report a wurtzite-derived structure corresponding to the kesterite structure, namely, wurtzite-kesterite (space group $Pc$), which is the ground state for some ${\\text{I}}_{2}{\\text{-II-IV-VI}}_{4}$ compounds, but is easily confused with the wurtzite-stannite (space-group $Pmn{2}_{1}$) structure. We show that there is a clear relationship between the properties of the wurtzite-kesterite and zinc-blende-derived kesterite structures, as well as between wurtzite-stannite and stannite. Contributions from the strain and Coulomb energies are found to play an important role in determining the structural stability. The underlying trends can be explained according to the size and ionicity of the group-I, -II, -IV, and -VI atoms. Electronic-structure calculations show that the wurtzite-derived structures have properties similar to the zinc-blende-derived structures, but their band gaps are relatively larger, which has also been observed for binary II-VI semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "The kesterite-structured semiconductors Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnSe4 are drawing considerable attention recently as the active layers in earth-abundant low-cost thin-film solar cells. The additional number of elements in these quaternary compounds, relative to binary and ternary semiconductors, results in increased flexibility in the material properties. Conversely, a large variety of intrinsic lattice defects can also be formed, which have important influence on their optical and electrical properties, and hence their photovoltaic performance. Experimental identification of these defects is currently limited due to poor sample quality. Here recent theoretical research on defect formation and ionization in kesterite materials is reviewed based on new systematic calculations, and compared with the better studied chalcopyrite materials CuGaSe2 and CuInSe2. Four features are revealed and highlighted: (i) the strong phase-competition between the kesterites and the coexisting secondary compounds; (ii) the intrinsic p-type conductivity determined by the high population of acceptor CuZn antisites and Cu vacancies, and their dependence on the Cu/(Zn+Sn) and Zn/Sn ratio; (iii) the role of charge-compensated defect clusters such as [2CuZn+SnZn], [VCu+ZnCu] and [ZnSn+2ZnCu] and their contribution to non-stoichiometry; (iv) the electron-trapping effect of the abundant [2CuZn+SnZn] clusters, especially in Cu2ZnSnS4. The calculated properties explain the experimental observation that Cu poor and Zn rich conditions (Cu/(Zn+Sn) \u2248 0.8 and Zn/Sn \u2248 1.2) result in the highest solar cell efficiency, as well as suggesting an efficiency limitation in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 cells when the S composition is high.",

It is shown that under typical experimental conditions nitrogen prefers to substitute at a Ti-site and bond to two or three neighboring oxygen ions, forming nitrite or nitrate molecules. This leaves one Ti-vacancy and under-coordinated oxygen ions that produce a large electron density of states at the valence band edge, with localized characters slightly extending into the pristine TiO2 band gap, due to an altered local electrostatic potential and orbital interactions. We suggest that this large electronic density of states at the valence band edge is responsible for the enhanced subgap tail absorption observed in N-doped anatase TiO2 and hence the visible-light photocatalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Current knowledge of the intrinsic defect properties of ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{ZnSnS}}_{4}$ (CZTS) is limited, which is hindering further improvement of the performance of CZTS-based solar cells. Here, we have performed first-principles calculations for a series of intrinsic defects and defect complexes in CZTS, from which we have the following observations. (i) It is important to control the elemental chemical potentials during crystal growth to avoid the formation of secondary phases such as ZnS, CuS, and ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{SnS}}_{3}$. (ii) The intrinsic $p$-type conductivity is attributed to the ${\\text{Cu}}_{\\text{Zn}}$ antisite which has a lower formation energy and relatively deeper acceptor level compared to the Cu vacancy. (iii) The low formation energy of many of the acceptor defects will lead to the intrinsic $p$-type character, i.e., $n$-type doping is very difficult in this system. (iv) The role of electrically neutral defect complexes is predicted to be important, because they have remarkably low formation energies and electronically passivate deep levels in the band gap. For example, $[{\\text{Cu}}_{\\text{Zn}}^{\\ensuremath{-}}+{\\text{Zn}}_{\\text{Cu}}^{+}]$, $[{V}_{\\text{Cu}}^{\\ensuremath{-}}+{\\text{Zn}}_{\\text{Cu}}^{+}]$, and $[{\\text{Zn}}_{\\text{Sn}}^{2\\ensuremath{-}}+2{\\text{Zn}}_{\\text{Cu}}^{+}]$ may form easily in nonstoichiometric samples. The band alignment between ${\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{ZnSnS}}_{4}$, ${\\text{CuInSe}}_{2}$ and the solar-cell window layer CdS has also been calculated, revealing that a type-II band alignment exists for the $\\text{CdS}/{\\text{Cu}}_{2}{\\text{ZnSnS}}_{4}$ heterojunction. The fundamental differences between CZTS and ${\\text{CuInSe}}_{2}$ for use in thin-film photovoltaics are discussed. The results are expected to be relevant to other ${\\text{I}}_{2}{\\text{-II-IV-VI}}_{4}$ semiconductors.",

The band gap of the CZTSSe alloy decreases with the Se content almost linearly, and the band alignment between Cu${}_{2}$ZnSnS${}_{4}$ and Cu${}_{2}$ZnSnSe${}_{4}$ is of type I, which allows for more facile $n$-type and $p$-type doping for alloys with high Se content. Based on these results we analyze the influence of composition on the efficiency of CZTSSe solar cells and explain the high efficiency of the cells with high Se content.",

In the first step, reaction of the boron enolate of (S)-N-propionyl-5,5-dimethyl-oxazolidin-2-one with a series of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes affords their corresponding syn-aldol products in high de. In the second step, directed cyclopropanation of the alkene functionalities of these syn-aldols occurs under the stereodirecting effect of their \u2018temporary\u2019\u03b2-hydroxyl stereocentres to give a series of cyclopropyl-aldols in high de. Finally, retro-aldol cleavage of the lithium alkoxide of these cyclopropyl-aldols results in destruction of their temporary \u03b2-hydroxy stereocentres to afford the parent chiral auxiliary and chiral cyclopropane-carboxaldehydes in >95% ee. The potential of this methodology has been demonstrated for the asymmetric synthesis of the cyclopropane containing natural product cascarillic acid in good yield.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Significant structural rearrangements of these particles occurred, primarily at the edges and corners of the particles, and 3 and 5 membered (Al\u2013F\u2013)n ring structures were observed in addition to the 4-membered rings seen in bulk \u03b1-AlF3. These 3 and 5 membered ring structures are, however, present in other metastable forms of AlF3, which are formed at low temperatures from high surface area precursors. The surfaces of the nanoparticles were very dynamic on the timescale of the MD run, Al\u2013F bonds being continually broken and formed, resulting in the movement of the low coordinate Lewis acid Al sites on the surfaces of the particles. The Lewis acid sites, which represent the catalytically active sites for F/Cl exchange reactions, are largely present at the corners and edges of the particles. The particles show larger rhombohedral distortions than present in the bulk phase and do not undergo a rhombohedral to cubic phase transition at elevated temperatures. The results are compared with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis results from fluorinated \u03b3-Al2O3, nanoparticles of AlF3 prepared by plasma routes and \u03b1- and \u03b2-AlF3. Broad peaks between 3.3 and 4.5 \u00c5 in the PDF plots of the fluorinated Al2O3 and the nanoparticles indicate a distribution of Al\u2013F distances arising from Al and F atoms in connected AlF6 octahedra; this is consistent with the presence of ring structures other than those found in \u03b1-AlF3.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Deuterium labelling studies show that the mono-alkynyl complexes are formed via hydrogen transfer from a coordinated alkyne ligand to Ru\u2013OH, while bis-alkynyl formation is proposed to take place through hydrogen transfer to Ru\u2013H. Both 3 and 5 readily coordinate CO to give the corresponding dicarbonyl species 6 and 7. Addition of HCCPh to the hydride chloride precursor [Ru(IMes)2(CO)HCl] (2) results in a different reaction pathway involving alkyne insertion into the Ru\u2013H bond to yield the alkenyl chloride complex [Ru(IMes)2(CO)(CHCHPh)Cl] 8.

Thin films with uniform pore structure were obtained after controlled evaporation of solvents in a humid atmosphere. Solvent, polymer concentration and humidity were found to be important factors in the formation of honeycomb-structured thin films. Preliminary cell culture studies with MG-63 osteoblast-like cell lines showed promising degrees of cell attachment and proliferation on these films, suggesting that they are applicable as scaffolds for tissue engineering.",

Specifically, linear compounds comprising one, two, or four dihexylfluorene (F) moieties together with one fluorenone (O) moiety placed either at the end or in the center of each chain (i.e., FO, FFO, FOF, FFOFF) are studied. The results support the recent observation that the photophysics of the fluorenone-centered \u201cpentamer\u201d (FFOFF) is most similar to that of oxidized PFs. They further demonstrate that molecule\u2013molecule interaction is essential to activate the green emission band. Investigations by X-ray diffraction (XRD) identify the solid-state structure of a representative member of this class of compounds and reveal inter-molecular interaction through dipole\u2013dipole coupling between neighboring fluorenone moieties.",

Formate has wide industrial applications and is seen as valuable within fuel cell technologies as well as an interesting H2-storage compound. Heterogenization of molecular rhodium catalysts is accomplished via the synthesis, post-synthetic linker exchange, and characterization of a new metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) Cp*Rh@UiO-67. While the catalytic activities of the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems are found to be comparable, the MOF-based system is more stable and selective. Furthermore it can be recycled without loss of activity. For formate production, an optimal catalyst loading of \u223c10\u2009% molar Rh incorporation is determined. Increased incorporation of rhodium catalyst favors thermal decomposition of formate into H2. There is no precedent for a MOF catalyzing the latter reaction so far.",

    "abstract": "This chapter introduces fundamental computational approaches and ideas to energy materials. These can be divided into two main streams: one dealing with the motion of atoms or ions described at a simplified level of theory and another focusing on electrons. The modeling framework, which covers both streams, is outlined. The atomistic simulation techniques discussed in the chapter are concerned with describing the energy landscape of individual atoms or ions, where classical mechanics can be usefully employed as the first successful approximation. Multiscale approaches could be the method of choice if one is interested in large molecules, inhomogeneous solids, complex environments or geometrical arrangements, systems that are far away from equilibrium or have particularly long evolution times. One of the principal objectives of atomistic simulations is to derive an accurate and coherent approach to the prediction of defect structure, energetics and properties. Two of the most widely employed methods are outlined.",

The xanthate precursors are far superior to the dithiocarbamates in their ability to produce oxide-free Sb2S3. Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) provided a means to produce good quality films of Sb2S3.

    "abstract": "AbstractIllicit drug use is a global phenomenon involving millions of individuals, which results in serious health and social costs. The chemical analysis of urban wastewater for the excretion products of illicit drugs is a potent approach for monitoring patterns and trends of illicit drug use in a community. The first international and multidisciplinary conference on this topic was recently organized to present the epidemiological knowledge of patterns in drug use and the information obtained from wastewater analysis. This paper gives an overview of the main issues that emerged during the conference, focusing on the identified research gaps and requirements and on the future challenges and opportunities from bringing together wastewater analysis and drug epidemiology. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) uses an established multi-indicator system to monitor illicit drug use and to identify the emergence of new psychoactive substances. The methodological challenges of monitoring a hidden and stigmatized behavior like drug use include the limitations of self-report data and reporting delays. An increasing evidence base suggests that wastewater analysis can address some of these problems. Specifically this technique can: monitor temporal and spatial trends in drug use at different scales, provide updated estimates of drug use, and identify changing habits and the use of new substances. A best practice protocol developed by a Europe-wide network of experts is available to produce homogeneous and comparable data at different sites. The systematic evaluation of uncertainties related to wastewater analysis has highlighted which areas require careful control and those that need further investigation to generally improve the approach. Wastewater analysis has considerable potential to complement existing approaches for monitoring drug use due to its ability to produce objective, real-time estimates of drug use and to give timely information of any change in the patterns of use.",

    "abstract": " We have examined the combined effects of grain morphology and electron trapping on the transient response of photoelectrons moving through the TiO2 grains in a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cell using a multi-time-scale random walk Monte Carlo model. Our use of a multi-time-scale approach enables us to simulate transport for electrons moving through spherical connected grains in a three-dimensional (3D) voided network and look at the effect of the size of interparticle boundaries on carrier dynamics. We can also address similar times to those over which measurements are taken, namely, 0.1 ms. These times are long because of deep traps in the TiO2 grains. The grains have 2-fold connectivity in one dimension (linear chains) or 4-fold or 6-fold connectivity in three dimensions and traps with an exponential distribution of energies. Photoelectrons are generated by a light pulse of short duration. The spatial distribution of the photogenerated electron density from this pulse either has a uniform profile or is peaked on the electrolyte side. We show that the constrictions at the grain necks slow the electrons, making trapping more likely and hence further delaying their passage to the extracting electrode. By comparing our results for 4-fold and 6-fold coordinated particles on a cubic lattice with 2-fold coordinated particles on linear chains, we show that transport is slowed in the former case due to the additional paths available to the electrons in the 3D network. We also find that the charge and current transients cannot be fit to an analytical solution of the continuum equations with an effective diffusion coefficient even at long times. Therefore, caution must be exercised when attempting to fit experimental transient data with an effective diffusion coefficient.  ",

    "abstract": " Microwave reflectance methods have been used to study the kinetics of photogeneration of hydrogen on p-Si in acidic fluoride solutions. To estimate the rate constant for interfacial electron transfer, the magnitude of the observed steady-state light-induced microwave reflectivity change has been compared quantitatively with theoretical predictions based on numerical calculation of the electron and hole profiles in the silicon sample. In addition, the transient and periodic microwave reflectivity responses to stepped and sinusoidally modulated illumination, respectively, have been analyzed to obtain information about the electrode kinetics. The time constants for relaxation of the light-induced conductivity derived from this analysis confirm that electron transfer during hydrogen evolution is slow. The apparent inconsistency in the values of the phenomenological electron-transfer rate constants derived from the steady-state and transient or periodic responses can be resolved if it is assumed that hydrogen evolution proceeds via electron capture by protons followed by a slow bimolecular step leading to molecular hydrogen. Surface charging as the result of slow kinetics is expected to lead to band edge unpinning even at low light intensities, and the existence of this effect has been confirmed by transient photocapacitance measurements.

The phosphasalens are analogues of the well-known salen ligands but with iminophosphorane donors replacing the imine functionality. The three yttrium alkoxide complexes show mono- and dinuclear structures in the solid state, depending on the substituents on the ligand. The new ligands and complexes are characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The complexes are all rapid initiators for lactide polymerization; they show excellent polymerization control on addition of exogeneous alcohol. The mononuclear complex shows extremely rapid rates and a high degree of stereocontrol in rac-lactide polymerization, yielding heterotactic PLA (Ps of 0.9). The phosphasalens are, therefore, excellent ligands for lactide ring-opening polymerization catalysis showing superior rates and stereocontrol versus salen ligands, which may be related to their excellent donating ability and the high degrees of steric protection they can confer.",

A third route was tested, involving the addition of excesses of PMe3 to the complexes [Co(\u03ba2N,N\u2032-NC4H3C(R)\u2550N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)2] (R = H 1e; Me 1f), which was only successful for the synthesis of 3a, in lower yields (ca. 30%). The synthesis of 3b in THF was unfruitful because of the kinetic competition of the solvent, giving rise to mixtures of 1f and its coordinated THF adduct 4b. The synthesis of the new bis-iminopyrrolyl five-coordinate Co(II) complexes [Co(\u03ba2N,N\u2032-NC4H3C(R)\u2550N-2,6-iPr2C6H3)2(THF)] (R = H 4a; Me 4b) were carried out in high yields (ca. 80\u221290%) by the reaction of CoCl2(THF)1.5 with the corresponding iminopyrrolyl Na salt. All the compounds have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, with 3a and 3b showing axially compressed trigonal bipyramidal geometry (with the PMe3 ligand lying on the equatorial plane), whereas complexes 4a and 4b exhibit distorted square pyramidal geometries with the THF molecule occupying the axial position. Complex 4a shows clearly a compressed geometry, but for complex 4b, two polymorphs were characterized, exhibiting molecules with different Co\u2212O (THF) bond lengths, one of them being compatible with an elongated form. Magnetic measurements either in the solid or in the liquid phases indicate that complexes 3a and 3b have low-spin ground states (S = 1/2). In toluene solution, the geometry is fully confirmed by EPR data, which further indicates a dx2\u2212y2/dxy ground state. However, compounds 4a and 4b behave unusually because they show magnetic moments that are compatible with high-spin ground states (S = 3/2) in the solid state, but conform to low-spin ground states (S = 1/2) when both complexes are dissolved in toluene solutions. The low-spin ground states in toluene solution are confirmed by EPR spectroscopy, which further supports, for complexes 4a and 4b, an axially elongated square pyramidal geometry and a dz2 ground state. Thus the change in the ground-state and, consequently, in the geometry of complexes 4a and 4b from solid state to toluene solution might be a consequence of the elongation of the Co\u2212O(THF) bond length. DFT studies performed on complexes 3 and 4 corroborate their different structure and magnetic behaviors and verify, for the latter complexes, the structural differences observed in the solid state and in toluene solution.",

However, with significant regularity, these methods prove to be incompatible with the substrate under consideration. Therefore, niche noncatalytic methods, such as diimide reductions, find an important role in structurally sensitive substrates. This review covers recent progress in the deployment of noncatalytic chemical methods, including the increasingly popular use of diimide as a reductant.",

    "abstract": "The activity of the two related complexes [Cp*Ir(IMe)2X]BF4 (X = Cl (1), H (2)) in transfer hydrogenation from isopropyl alcohol to acetophenone was investigated. The results suggest that the commonly accepted monohydride mechanism for transfer hydrogenation mediated by cyclopentadienyl iridium species does not apply to chloride 1. We have found evidence that, although the two monodentate NHC ligands are retained in the coordination sphere, the Cp* ligand is completely released under mild conditions in a precatalytic activation step. Synthesis of modified versions of the initial precatalyst 1 with different cyclopentadienyl and NHC ligands demonstrated that increasing the steric pressure around the iridium center facilitates precatalyst activation and thus enhances the catalytic performance. Study of five new iridium(III) complexes bearing mono- or diphosphines helped us monitor Cp* ligand loss under mild conditions. An unusual P\u2013C bond cleavage was also noted in a 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)methane (dmpm) ligand. On the basis of these findings, a novel catalyst activation mechanism is proposed for [(\u03b75-C5R5)Ir] transfer hydrogenation based on the lability of the cyclopentadienyl ligand.Keywords:  transfer hydrogenation; Cp*Ir complexes; cyclopentadienyl ligands; N-heterocyclic carbenes; homogeneous catalysis; steric pressure",

A set of homoleptic bis-ligand Co(II) complexes of the type [Co(\u03ba2N,N\u2018-NC4H3C(R)N-2,6-R\u20182C6H3)2] (R = R\u2018= H, 3a; R = Me, R\u2018= H, 3b; R = H, R\u2018 = Me, 3c; R = R\u2018 = Me, 3d; R = H, R\u2018 = iPr, 3e; R = Me, R\u2018 = iPr, 3f) was prepared by reaction of CoCl2 with the corresponding iminopyrrolyl sodium salts 2a\u2212f. The new complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility measurements, in powder and in solution, UV/vis/NIR, and, in some cases, X-ray crystallography. According to X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements, the Co complexes 3a\u2212e proved to be tetrahedral, which is the preferred geometry for Co(II) compounds. However, a square planar geometry is observed in the case of 3f, as determined by several characterization techniques. In this case, DFT calculations suggest the square planar geometry is slightly more stable than the tetrahedral one probably due to a combination of steric and electronic reasons.  ",

The nanoparticle binding was followed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR), and the minimum angle shift was related to surface coverage using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An S-shaped binding isotherm was obtained; in all cases binding saturated at submonolayer coverage. Submonolayer formation was attributed to an exponential fall in the association affinity constant, ka, as a function of surface coverage.

The work involved the quantification of film thickness on the micron scale through tracking oscillations in the amplitude and phase angles using single-angle, single-wavelength ellipsometry. Our results allow us to propose the following interfacial mechanism: film growth resulting from the association between trimethylammonium groups on surfactant micelles with lone pairs of electrons on the primary amine groups of long polymer chains, then arrest of the growth resulting from CO2 adsorption which increases the cationic charge density of the polyelectrolyte, followed by total film collapse resulting from its drying out and breakup into solid particles. We relate stages of the film development to the evolution of a Bragg peak using neutron reflectometry, where the highest degree of micellar ordering occurs just after the rapid growth stage and the loss of definition of the mesostructure is well correlated with the final collapse of the film. We also link the development to characteristic changes in the lateral film morphology using Brewster angle microscopy, including wrinkling during film growth and circular defects during collapse.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Various bio-electrochemical technologies have made use of this reductive cellular capacity, but there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of cellular reduction rates under different conditions. This study used electrochemical techniques to further investigate the reductive interactions of Synechocystis cells with Fe(III) from the iron species potassium ferricyanide, with varying cell and ferricyanide concentrations present. At the lowest cell concentrations tested, cell reduction machinery appeared to kinetically limit the reduction reaction, but ferricyanide reduction rates were mass transport controlled at the higher cell and ferricyanide concentrations studied. Improving the understanding of the reduction of Fe(III) by whole cyanobacterial cells is important for improving the efficiencies of technologies that rely on this interaction.",

Especially important is the ability to quantify the filling of such films with guest molecules, be they dyes or proteins. In this paper we have demonstrated a simple methodology for the highly sensitive monitoring of nanoporous titania films as protein is both adsorbed in, and removed from the film matrix: optical waveguide mode spectroscopy. Porous titania films of thickness between 0.5 and 1.5 \u03bcm were created on gold slides by the deposition of a colloidal suspension of titanium dioxide nanoparticles with a phytate binder. Absorption of cytochrome c into the highly porous titanium structure was followed by both optical waveguide spectroscopy (OWS) and electrochemistry. OWS showed that saturation occurred when 27% of the pore volume was filled with cytochrome c and initial diffusion coefficients of 10\u221217 m2 s\u22121 were measured for cytochrome c within the pores. Electrochemical measurements displayed good agreement with OWS measurements and showed that the protein permeated all the way through the porous film to the gold substrate. The results further demonstrate that the OWS method is more than two orders of magnitude more sensitive than classical electrochemical methods conventionally used to study such systems, and is not dependent on having a redox-active adsorbate.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Enantiomeric profiling of chiral pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in the environment has hardly been investigated. This manuscript describes, for the first time, a multi-residue enantioselective method for the analysis of human and veterinary chiral PACs and their main metabolites from different therapeutic groups in complex environmental samples such as wastewater and river water. Several analytes targeted in this paper have not been analysed in the environment at enantiomeric level before. These are aminorex, carboxyibuprofen, carprofen, cephalexin, 3-N-dechloroethylifosfamide, 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine, dihydroketoprofen, fenoprofen, fexofenadine, flurbiprofen, 2-hydroxyibuprofen, ifosfamide, indoprofen, mandelic acid, 2-phenylpropionic acid, praziquantel and tetramisole. The method is based on chiral liquid chromatography utilising a chiral \u03b11-acid glycoprotein column and tandem mass spectrometry detection. Excellent chromatographic separation of enantiomers (Rs\u22651.0) was achieved for chloramphenicol, fexofenadine, ifosfamide, naproxen, tetramisole, ibuprofen and their metabolites: aminorex and dihydroketoprofen (three of four enantiomers), and partial separation (Rs\u2009=\u20090.7\u20131.0) was achieved for ketoprofen, praziquantel and the following metabolites: 3-N-dechloroethylifosfamide and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine. The overall performance of the method was satisfactory for most of the compounds targeted. Method detection limits were at low nanogram per litre for surface water and effluent wastewater. Method intra-day precision was on average under 20\u00a0% and sample pre-concentration using solid phase extraction yielded recoveries >70\u00a0% for most of the analytes. This novel, selective and sensitive method has been applied for the quantification of chiral PACs in surface water and effluent wastewater providing excellent enantioresolution of multicomponent mixtures in complex environmental samples. It will help with better understanding of the role of individual enantiomers in the environment and will enable more accurate environmental risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "An effective synthesis strategy for the extensive fluorination of the TiO2 anatase lattice has been developed which provides a highly stable blue-colored titania powder. The process also produces a convenient faceted morphology of the doped nanoparticles. Both theoretical and experimental data indicate an ordered atomic structure, in which an exceptionally high amount of fluorine ions substitute oxygen ions in the TiO2 lattice. The extra-electrons borne by fluorine are stabilized by lattice Ti cations via a mechanism of valence induction, eventually leading to a consequent high amount of reduced Ti3+ centers. Such structure, whose general formula can be expressed as Ti4+(1-x)Ti3+xO2\u2013(2-x)F\u2013x, confers an excellent stability to the as-synthesized nanoparticles (in spite of the excess electrons), explaining for example why the blue color is retained even upon storage in ambient atmosphere. But moreover, the high concentration of the relatively shallow Ti3+ generated states also form a sort of sub-band close to the bottom of the conduction band itself. The whole effect results in a tangible decrease (0.2 eV) of the anatase band gap which allows an inspiring upgrading of its UV photocatalytic activity. Our results also suggest that narrowing the band gap is insufficient for a substantial improvement in the visible light harvesting.",

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) has been recently proposed as a promising harmless substitute for hydrofluoric acid (HF) in preparing fluorine-modified anatase with good scavenger properties. However the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2 nanoparticles also depends on their specific morphology, by which the number and type of crystal facets, which remain exposed, are determined. A comprehensive study is presented in this contribution which for the first time describes the role of TFAA in stabilizing the highly photoactive {001} TiO2 facets. Furthermore, by reducing the amount of water incorporated into the reaction medium, a simple one-step synthesis method is also proposed that allows the preparation of TFAA-modified anatase nanoparticles with specific morphology and selected stabilized facets, eventually yielding a semiconductor material with excellent photocatalytic properties.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

This includes the first observations of the anomalous photovoltaic effect (APE) and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPE). The recent successful application of inorganic and hybrid perovskite structured materials (e.g. BiFeO3, CsSnI3, CH3NH3PbI3) in solar cells emphasises that polar semiconductors can be used in conventional photovoltaic architectures. We review developments in this field, with a particular emphasis on the materials known to display the APE/BPE (e.g. ZnS, CdTe, SbSI), and the theoretical explanation. Critical analysis is complemented with first-principles calculation of the underlying electronic structure. In addition to discussing the implications of a ferroelectric absorber layer, and the solid state theory of polarisation (Berry phase analysis), design principles and opportunities for high-efficiency ferroelectric photovoltaics are presented.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The choice of halide (Cl, Br or I) can be used to chemically tune the spectral response of the materials and the positions of the valence and conduction bands (i.e. the ionisation potential and electron affinity). Here the band offsets of the methylammonium lead halides are reported, including relativistic corrections and using the Pb 1s core level as a reference state. The binding energy of the valence band decreases monotonically down the series, primarily due to the change from 3p to 4p to 5p valence orbitals of the halide.

If these materials are to be employed in devices, it is necessary to develop an understanding of their solid-state behavior. We report an approach to calculate the effect of strain on the band structure of porous frameworks. The origin of the bidirectional absolute deformation potentials can be described from perturbations of the organic and inorganic building blocks. The unified approach allows us to propose several uses for hybrid materials, beyond their traditionally posited applications, including gas sensing, photoelectrochemistry, and as hybrid transistors.Keywords:  electronic structure; MOF; hybrid solid; deformation; band gap engineering",

    "abstract": "Nickel has been proposed as a low-cost alternative to silver for  contacting in high-performance solar cells. Nickel at a crystalline silicon surface can form a number of silicide phases, depending on fabrication conditions. Using density functional theory calculations we calculate the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the different possible interfaces. Depending on the silicide phase, crystallographic orientation and doping the SBH at the interface with Si can range from 0.39 to 0.70\u00a0eV. These calculations demonstrate which of the nickel (silicide) phases have potential use as contacting materials for silicon based solar cells. Furthermore, we explain the origin of the SBH tuning effect of P dopant atoms as being due to a dipole formed at the interface, demonstrating the linear relationship between the charge transfer at the interface upon doping and the concomitant modulation of the SBH.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe alignment of band energies between conductive oxides and semiconductors is crucial for the further development of oxide contacting layers in electronic devices. The growth of ultra thin films on the surface of an oxide material can be used to introduce a dipole moment at that surface due to charge differences. The dipole, in turn, alters the electrostatic potential \u2014 and hence the band energies \u2014 in the substrate oxide. We demonstrate the fundamental limits for the application of thin-films in this context, applying analytical and numerical simulations, that bridge continuum and atomistic. The simulations highlight the different parameters that can affect the band energy shifting potential of a given thin-film layer, taking the examples of MgO and SnO2. In particular we assess the effect of formal charge, layer orientation, layer thickness and surface coverage, with respect to their effect on the electrostatic potential. The results establish some design principles, important for further development and application of thin-films for band energy engineering in transparent conductive oxide materials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTiO2 remains the most widely studied metal oxide for photocatalytic reactions. The standard approach to reduce the band gap of titania, for increasing the absorption of visible light, is anion modification. For example the formation of an oxynitride compound, where the nitrogen 2p states decrease the binding energy of the valence band. We demonstrate that cation modification can produce a similar effect through the formation of a ternary oxide combining Ti and an ns2 cation, Sn(II). In Sn2TiO4, the underlying Ti 3d conduction states remain largely unmodified and an electronic band gap of 2.1\u00a0eV (590\u00a0nm) is predicted by hybrid density functional theory. Our analysis indicates a strong potential for Sn2TiO4 in visible-light driven photocatalysis, which should prove superior to the alternative (SnO2)1\u2212x(TiO2)x solid-solution.",

Of particular note is the recent isolation of zincblende SnS in particles and thin-films. Herein, first-principles calculations are employed to better understand this novel geometry and its place within the tin sulfide multiphasic system. We report the enthalpies of formation for the known phases of SnS, SnS2, and Sn2S3, with good agreement between theory and experiment for the ground-state structures of each. While theoretical X-ray diffraction patterns do agree with the assignment of the zincblende phase demonstrated in the literature, the structure is not stable close to the lattice parameters observed experimentally, exhibiting an unfeasibly large pressure and a formation enthalpy much higher than any other phase. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal spontaneous degradation to an amorphous phase much lower in energy, as Sn(II) is inherently unstable in a regular tetrahedral environment. We conclude that the known rocksalt phase of SnS has been mis-assigned as zincblende in the recent literature.",

Single crystal X-ray structures of {[Cu2(5-nbdc)2(DMF)2]\u00b72DMF}\u221e (1) and {[Cu2(5-nbdc)2(DMF)2]\u00b73\u2153DMF}\u221e (2) revealed similar sheet structures, containing triangular and hexagonal pores, but differences in the stacking of the sheets. Magnetic measurements on 1 and 2 are consistent with antiferromagnetic dimers containing a small quantity of paramagnetic impurity. The desolvated forms of 1 and 2 were applied as Lewis acid catalysts in the acetylation of methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate. When the reaction between Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O and H2(5-nbdc) was carried out in a mixture of DMF and water, the reaction gave metallomacrocycles of formula [Cu6(5-nbdc)6(H2O)12(DMF)6] (3). These assemble through hydrogen-bonding interactions to form a gross structure in which the macrocycle pores align into channels. The reaction between Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O and 5-methylsulfanylmethyl-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H2(5-msbdc), in DMF-water gave {[Cu2(5-msbdc)2(OH2)2]\u00b73DMF}\u221e (4), which contains similar sheets to those in 1 and 2, whereas the reaction with 5-amino-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H2(5-abdc), gave {[Cu2(5-abdc)2(DMF)2]}\u221e (5), which has a previously reported network based on sheets containing rhombohedral pores. The reaction between Cu(NO3)2\u00b73H2O and 2-methoxy-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, H2(2-mbdc), in DMF gave [Cu2(2-mbdc)2(DMF)2] (6). The presence of the substituent in the 2-position removes the co-planarity of the carboxylate groups, and the sheet structure adopted by 6 contains rhomboidal pores.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The reactions with AgNO3 and AgO2CCF3 both lead to compounds in which the anions are coordinated to the silver centres. Thus, the structure of [Ag2(NO3)2(bisox)] 1 contains helical silver-nitrate chains that are linked into sheets by bridging bisox ligands, whereas the structures of [Ag(O2CCF3)(bisox)]\u00b70.5X (2a, X = MeOH; 2b, X = MeCN) consist of sheets in which Ag2(\u03bc-O2CCF3)2 dimers act as 4-connecting nodes. In these structures bisox adopts the S-conformation, with the nitrogen donor atoms anti to each other. The reactions of bisox with AgClO4 and AgBF4 in methanol give the compounds [Ag2(bisox)3]X2 (3, X = ClO4; 5, X = BF4), the structures of which contain triply-interpenetrated sheets with Borromean links and ligands in the S-conformation. Recrystallisation of these compounds from acetonitrile\u2013diethyl ether gives [Ag2(bisox)3]X2\u00b7xEt2O (4, X = ClO4, x = 1; 6, X = BF4, x = 1.2). The structures of 4 and 6 contain similar triply-interpenetrated sheets to those in 3 and 5, though these are sandwiched between sheets of discrete Ag2(bisox)3 cages, in which the bisox ligands are in the C-conformation, with the nitrogen donor atoms syn to each other. Diethyl ether molecules project through the faces of the cages and template cage formation. Both 4 and 6 lose diethyl ether on heating in vacuum, and convert into 3 and 5, respectively. This solid state transformation requires a change in conformation of half the bisox ligands, with conversion of 6 into 5 occurring more readily than conversion of 4 into 3. The reactions of bisox with AgPF6 and AgSbF6 in methanol give mixtures of products from which [Ag(bisox)2]X\u00b70.5bisox (7, X = PF6; 8, X = SbF6) can be isolated. Both 7 and 8 have structures containing one-dimensional chains, in which the bisox ligands adopt C-conformations and interconnect distorted tetrahedral silver centres in a pairwise manner generating macrocycles. Additional uncoordinated bisox molecules lie within half of these macrocyclic rings. Recrystallisation of the crude AgSbF6/bisox reaction mixture from acetonitrile\u2013diethyl ether gives [Ag(bisox)2]SbF69, the structure of which consists of a triply-interpenetrated flattened diamondoid network. A similar structure was observed for [Ag(bisox)2]CF3SO310, which is formed from the reaction of AgO3SCF3 and bisox in methanol.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Compounds 1 and 3 have been previously reported, whereas 2 and 4 are both new. Compound 2 adopts a two-dimensional sheet structure, with the coordinated DMF ligands projecting from both sides of the sheets, whereas 4 has a complex three-dimensional structure related to the fsc net. When the reaction was repeated in the presence of pyrazine (pyz), the product [Cd(Hbtc)(pyz)(DMF)]\u00b7DMF 5 was isolated as a minor compound.

These complexes adopt molecular structures in which the metal centres contain distorted octahedral geometries. In contrast, the copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes [Cu(dppd)2] 5 and [Zn(dmppd)2] 6 both form polymeric structures in which coordination of the pyridyl groups into the axial positions of neighbouring metal centres links discrete square-planar complexes into two-dimensional networks. The europium complex [Eu(dmppd)2(H2O)4]Cl\u00b72EtOH\u00b70.5H2O 7 forms a structure containing discrete cations that are linked into sheets through hydrogen bonds, whereas the lanthanum complex [La(dmppd)3(H2O)]\u00b72H2O 8 adopts a one-dimensional network structure, connected into sheets by hydrogen bonds. The iron complexes 1 and 2 act as metalloligands in reactions with silver(I) salts, with the nature of the product depending on the counter-ions present. Thus, the reaction between 1 and AgBF4 gave [AgFe(dppd)3]BF4\u00b7DMSO 9, in which the silver centres link the metalloligands into discrete nanotubes, whereas reactions with AgPF6 and AgSbF6 gave [AgFe(dppd)3]PF6\u00b73.28DMSO 10 and [AgFe(dppd)3]SbF6\u00b71.25DMSO 11, in which the metalloligands are linked into sheets. In all three cases, only four of the six pyridyl groups present on the metalloligands are coordinated. The reaction between 2 and AgNO3 gave [Ag2Fe(dmppd)3(ONO2)]NO3\u00b7MeCN\u00b7CH2Cl212. Compound 12 adopts a layer structure in which all pyridyl groups are coordinated to silver centres and, in addition, a nitrate ion bridges between two silver centres. A similar structure is adopted by [Ag2Fe(dmppd)3(O2CCF3)]CF3CO2\u00b72MeCN\u00b70.25CH2Cl213, with a bridging trifluoroacetate ion playing the same role as the nitrate ion in 12.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The longer length of the substituent in biphenyl-4-carboxylate (bpc) allows for greater separation of the chains in [Cu2(bpc)4(pyz)]\u00b73.8BzOH 1 than has been previously observed in related benzoate compounds, leading to the formation of larger channels within the structure. In [Cu2(bpc)4(dabco)]\u00b7BzOH 2 and [Zn2(bpc)4(dabco)]\u00b72DMF 3, neighbouring chains are offset relative to each other, enabling them to pack more efficiently and reducing the channel width from that seen in 1.

When the reaction is undertaken in DMF, the product is [Zn3(OAc)6(HL11)4] 1, in which Zn(OAc)2 centres link Zn2(OAc)4(HL11)4 units into double-stranded zig-zag chains. Each chain is \u2018broken\u2019 after every fourth HL11 ligand, though the links between the chains ensure a coordination polymer is formed. The reaction in methanol produces [Zn(OAc)2(HL11)]\u00b70.5MeOH 2 which also contains double-stranded chains, though in this case both chains are continuous. The hydrothermal reaction gives [Zn(OAc)2(HL11)2]\u00b7H2O 3, which contains discrete zinc complex molecules that are linked into double-stranded chains through hydrogen bonds. Zinc(II) chloride reacts with HL11 to form [ZnCl2(L11)] 4. The structure of 4 consists of chains that are cross-linked into sheets by N\u2013H\u22efCl hydrogen bonds. The nitrates of zinc(II), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) react with 3,5-di(3-pyridyl)-1H-pyrazole (HL22) to form [M(MeOH)4(HL22)2](NO3)2\u00b72H2O (5, M = Zn; 6, M = Co; 7, M = Ni). These isostructural compounds contain discrete cations that are linked into double-stranded chains by O\u2013H\u22efN hydrogen bonds, with further hydrogen bonds connecting these into sheets.

The discrete [Cu6(\u03bc4-O)2(\u03bc3-SO4)4(\u03bc2-SO4)2(DMF)4]4\u2013 anions present in 1 contain two edge-sharing Cu4(\u03bc4-O) tetrahedra, with the copper(II) centers bridged by sulfato ligands. These anions are linked into a two-dimensional network through hydrogen bonds involving the dimethylammonium cations. When the reaction was carried out in the absence of [NMe2H2]Cl, yellow-green crystals of (NMe2H2)4[Cu6O2(SO4)6(DMF)2] 2 were obtained. The anions in 2 contain similar Cu6O2(SO4)6 aggregates to those in 1, though these differ in terms of the copper(II) coordination geometries. In addition, the anions in 2 are linked into chains through bridging sulfato ligands. The Cu6O2(SO4)6 aggregates observed in 1 and 2 are related to those present in the rare copper sulfate mineral fedotovite, K2Cu3O(SO4)3, and in common with this mineral both 1 and 2 decompose in the presence of moisture. The reaction between CuSO4\u00b75H2O and [NMe2H2]Cl in DMF at room temperature gave (NMe2H2)[Cu2(OH)(SO4)2(H2O)2] 3, the structure of which contains triangular Cu3(OH)(SO4) units that share vertices to form tapes. Magnetic measurements revealed that 1 and 3 are both spin-canting metamagnetic systems. Field-induced responses were observed below 5 K, with the critical field indicating metamagnetic behavior from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic equal to 110 Oe for both compounds.",

At 115 \u00b0C, the reaction gives [Cd(bdc)(DMF)]\u221e1, which has a three-dimensional network structure, whereas at 95 \u00b0C, 1 is formed alongside [Cd3(bdc)3(DMF)4]\u221e2, which has a two-dimensional network structure. When the reaction is carried out under pressure, it yields [Cd3(bdc)3(DMF)4]\u221e3, which is a supramolecular isomer of 2. The structure of 3 differs from that of 2 regarding the way the Cd3(O2CR)6 units are interlinked to form layers. When the reaction was carried out in DMF that had undergone partial hydrolysis, the only isolated product was {(NMe2H2)2[Cd(bdc)2]\u00b72DMF}\u221e4. Compound 4 has a three-dimensional triply-interpenetrated diamondoid structure, with dimethylammonium cations and DMF molecules included within the pores. The reaction between Cd(NO3)2\u00b74H2O and H2bdc in DEF gave [Cd(bdc)(DEF)]\u221e5, regardless of the solvent quality. Compound 5 has a three-dimensional network structure. The reaction of Cd(NO3)2\u00b74H2O and 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2mbdc) in DMF gave [Cd(mbdc)(DMF)]\u221e6 which has a bilayer structure. The thermal properties of the new materials have been investigated, and the coordinated DEF molecules from 5 can be removed on heating to 400 \u00b0C without any change in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. The H2 sorption isotherm for the desolvated material shows marked hysteresis between adsorption and desorption, and less adsorption than predicted by simulations. Kinetic data indicate that the hysteresis is not due to mass transfer limitations, and the most likely explanation for this behaviour lies in partial collapse of the framework to an amorphous phase under the conditions of activation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Analysis of the nitrogen isotherm revealed the material to have a BET surface area of 1088 m2 g\u22121, which is approximately one-third of the value calculated from GCMC simulations, suggesting incomplete activation or pore blocking in the activated material. The reaction of cobalt(II) nitrate and H2edb in DMF gave [Co3(edb)3(DMF)4]\u00b72.6DMF 2. The structure of 2 is based on Co3(O2CR)6 linear secondary building units that are linked by the edb ligands into a two-dimensional network. When 2 was placed under vacuum, a colour change from pale pink to deep blue was observed, which is consistent with loss of the coordinated DMF molecules. When treated with [Co2(CO)8], crystals of 1 turned dark red, and IR analysis is consistent with coordination of Co2(CO)6 fragments to the alkyne groups. However, the colour change was restricted to the external crystal surfaces. This is a likely consequence of partial framework collapse, which occurs following coordination of Co2(CO)6 to the alkyne groups. Coordination changes the preferred angle between carboxylate groups in the edb ligand, which in turn introduces strain into the network.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

These MC-MOFs can be prepared directly, using more than one metal or ligand in the synthesis, or formed by post-synthetic modification. A second class of MC-MOFs have core\u2013shell structures, and these can be prepared through epitaxial growth of one MOF on the surface of another or post-synthetic modification of the crystal surfaces.

X-Ray crystallographic analyses of complexes 1 and 2 indicated the presence of bifurcated hydrogen bonds between the NH protons and both the chloride ligands and the ether oxygen atoms. Reaction of 1, 5 and 7 with two equivalents of AgBF4 led to formation of trans-[Pd(L1)2][BF4]29 and cis-[PtL2][BF4]2 (L\u00a0=\u00a0L1; 10 or L411) containing bidentate P,O-co-ordinated ligands whereas reaction of 1 with one equivalent of AgBF4 gave exclusively [{Pd(\u03bc-Cl)(L1)2}2][BF4]212, containing only unidentate aminophosphine ligands. Reaction of 5 and 8 with NaNO2 led to formation of cis-[PtX(NO2)(L1)2] (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl 13 or Br 14). Shielding of one of the NH protons with respect to 5 and 8 suggested loss of N\u2013H\u22efX hydrogen bonding and this was confirmed by an X-ray crystallographic analysis of 14. Reaction of L1\u20134 with [{M(dmba)(\u03bc-Cl)}2] (M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd or Pt; Hdmba\u00a0=\u00a0N,N-dimethylbenzylamine) gave [M(dmba)ClL] (16, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd, L\u00a0=\u00a0L1; 17, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd, L\u00a0=\u00a0L2; 18, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd, L\u00a0=\u00a0L3; 19, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd, L\u00a0=\u00a0L4; 20, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pt, L\u00a0=\u00a0L1; 21, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pt, L\u00a0=\u00a0L2; 22, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pt, L\u00a0=\u00a0L4). The crystal structure of 16 reveals a similar bifurcated hydrogen bond to those observed in 1 and 2, whereas the structure of 18 shows the N\u2013H\u22efCl interaction to be present but the N\u2013H\u22efO interaction absent. Reaction of 16, 20 and 22 with AgBF4 gave the bidentate P,O-co-ordinated complexes [M(dmba)L]BF4 (23, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pd, L\u00a0=\u00a0L1; 24, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pt, L\u00a0=\u00a0L1; 25, M\u00a0=\u00a0Pt, L\u00a0=\u00a0L4). Displacement of the co-ordinated ether oxygen was achieved by reaction of 24 and 25 with CO and of 25 with xylyl isocyanide and acetonitrile. Attempts to recrystallise 24 led instead to isolation of the dinuclear species [{Pt(dmba)(\u03bc-PPh2O)}2] 30 which was characterised by X-ray crystallography.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Reaction of two equivalents of L1,2 with [PtCl2(cod)] gave the complexes cis-[PtCl2L2] (L\u00a0=\u00a0L11 or L22), which were shown to be fluxional with one of the amine groups reversibly co-ordinating to displace a chloride. Removal of a chloride in 1 by metathesis gave cis-[PtCl(L1-P)(L1-P,N)]PF63 which was not fluxional on the NMR timescale. Reaction of one equivalent of L2 with [PtCl2(cod)] gave the complex cis-[PtCl2(L2-P,N)] 4 in which L2 is acting as a bidentate ligand. The reaction of L2 with [{Pt(dmba)(\u03bc-Cl)}2] (Hdmba\u00a0=\u00a0N,N-dimethylbenzylamine) gave [Pt(dmba)Cl(L2)] 5, which exists as a mixture of the two geometric isomers. Reaction of 5 with TlPF6 gave [Pt(dmba)(L2-P,N)]-PF66 as a single isomer in which the phosphorus atom is co-ordinated trans to the N,N-dimethylbenzylamine nitrogen atom. Complex 2 reacts with CoCl2\u00b76H2O and ZnCl2 to give cis-[(L2-P,N)ClPt(\u03bc-L2)MCl3] (M\u00a0=\u00a0Co 7 or Zn 8).

Crystal structure determinations of the seven compounds demonstrate that in 2\u20137 bridging dicarboxylates link the zinc centres into polymeric chains, whereas in 8 bridging homophthalates lead to discrete dimers. Where permitted by the relative orientations of the carboxylates, the chains are linked together by pairs of N\u2013H\u22efO hydrogen bonds between thiourea NH groups and carboxylate oxygen atoms in a hydrogen bond donor\u2013donor acceptor\u2013acceptor (DD\u2236AA) arrangement. The hydrogen bonding patterns in the structure of 2 are very similar to those previously observed in [NEt4]2[fum]\u00b72tu, suggesting that incorporation of zinc has little effect on the gross structure. The supramolecular structures of 5 and 6 are very similar to each other, and also to that of the previously reported compound [Zn(tu)2(\u03bc-male)], which reflects the similar dispositions of the carboxylate groups. In contrast, the structure of 7 is very different, illustrating the dramatic effects that inclusion of solvent can have on the supramolecular structure.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Different products were isolated depending on the concentration of the gaseous reactants. For example, when 1 molar equivalent of carbon monoxide was added to [Pt3(\u00b5-SO2)3{P(C6H11)3}3](1) the monosubstituted carbon monoxide complex [Pt3(\u00b5-CO)(\u00b5-SO2)2{P(C6H11)3}3](2) was formed. However, with excess of carbon monoxide, using dichloromethane as the solvent, a relatively unstable dimer, [Pt2(\u00b5-SO2)(CO)2{P(C6H11)3}2](3) was isolated. This dimer was also prepared by the reaction of SO2 with [Pt3(\u00b5-CO)3{P(C6H11)3}3](5). With benzene as the solvent, compound (1) reacts with excess of CO to give the disubstituted cluster [Pt3(\u00b5-CO)2(\u00b5-SO2){P(C6H11)3}3](4). The molecular structure of (2) has been determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. It crystallises in monoclinic space group C2/m, with four units of formula [Pt3(\u00b5-CO)(\u00b5-SO2)2{P(C6H11)3}3]\u00b70.5C6H6 in a cell of dimensions of a= 24.909(9), b= 21.694(4), c= 15.559(4)\u00c5, and \u03b2= 125.41(3)\u00b0. The structure consists of an isosceles triangle of Pt atoms with Pt\u2013Pt distances of 2.678(1) and 2.710(1)\u00c5. The Pt\u2013Pt edges bridged by the sulphur dioxide ligands are appreciably longer than that bridged by carbon monoxide. The substitution chemistry of the mixed substituted clusters, (2) and (4) with xylyl isocyanide has been studied. The reactivities of both clusters resemble that of (1).\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

During the course of the reaction, the ligand L self-assembles on the metal center. The reaction between PPh(CH2OH)2, iron(II) chloride, ammonium chloride, and formaldehyde under similar conditions gives cis-[FeCl2L2] (cis-2). The complex cis-2 is converted into trans-2 in Et2O, whereas in water it is converted into cis-[Fe(OH2)2L2]2+, though both of these interconversions are reversible. The chloro ligands in cis-2 are readily displaced by reaction with thiocyanate, azide, and carbonate to give cis- and trans-[Fe(NCS)2L2] (cis- and trans-3), cis- and trans-[Fe(N3)2L2] (cis- and trans-4), and [Fe(\u03ba2-O2CO)L2] (5), respectively. The complex cis-2 reacts with CO in water to give trans-[FeCl(CO)L2]Cl (trans-6), whereas trans-2 reacts with CO in diethyl ether to give cis-[FeCl(CO)L2]Cl (cis-6), though cis-6 isomerizes in water to form trans-6. The reaction of cis-2 with sodium borohydride gives the hydride chloride complex trans-[FeCl(H)L2] (7). Electrochemical studies have been undertaken on complexes 1, cis-2, and 7. These reveal reversible oxidations for cis-2 and 7, with the latter giving rise to an unusual 17-electron iron(III) hydride chloride complex.

Complexes 1\u20133 have been structurally characterised and show square pyramidal geometries with apical hydride ligands. In both dichloromethane or pyridine solution, 1 and 2 display very low frequency hydride signals at about \u03b4 \u221241. The tetramethyl carbene complex 3 exhibits a similar chemical shift in toluene, but shows a higher frequency signal in acetonitrile arising from the solvent adduct [Ru(IMe4)4(MeCN)H][BArF4], 4. The reactivity of 1\u20133 towards H2 and N2 depends on the size of the N-substituent of the NHC ligand. Thus, 1 is unreactive towards both gases, 2 reacts with both H2 and N2 only at low temperature and incompletely, while 3 affords [Ru(IMe4)4(\u03b72-H2)H][BArF4] (7) and [Ru(IMe4)4(N2)H][BArF4] (8) in quantitative yield at room temperature. CO shows no selectivity, reacting with 1\u20133 to give [Ru(NHC)4(CO)H][BArF4] (9\u201311).

    "abstract": "Boronic acids can interact with Lewis bases to generate boronate anions, and they can also bind with diol units to form cyclic boronate esters. Boronic acid based receptor designs originated when Lorand and Edwards used the pH drop observed upon the addition of saccharides to boronic acids to determine their association constants. The inherent acidity of the boronic acid is enhanced when 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,4-diols react with boronic acids to form cyclic boronic esters (5, 6, or 7 membered rings) in aqueous media, and these interactions form the cornerstone of diol-based receptors used in the construction of sensors and separation systems.In addition, the recognition of saccharides through boronic acid complex (or boronic ester) formation often relies on an interaction between a Lewis acidic boronic acid and a Lewis base (proximal tertiary amine or anion). These properties of boronic acids have led to them being exploited in sensing and separation systems for anions (Lewis bases) and saccharides (diols).The fast and stable bond formation between boronic acids and diols to form boronate esters can serve as the basis for forming reversible molecular assemblies. In spite of the stability of the boronate esters\u2019 covalent B\u2013O bonds, their formation is reversible under certain conditions or under the action of certain external stimuli.The reversibility of boronate ester formation and Lewis acid\u2013base interactions has also resulted in the development and use of boronic acids within multicomponent systems. The dynamic covalent functionality of boronic acids with structure-directing potential has led researchers to develop a variety of self-organizing systems including macrocycles, cages, capsules, and polymers.This Account gives an overview of research published about boronic acids over the last 5 years. We hope that this Account will inspire others to continue the work on boronic acids and reversible covalent chemistry.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe present a simple and fast algorithm to test the thermodynamic stability and determine the necessary chemical environment for the production of a multiternary material, relative to competing phases and compounds formed from the constituent elements. If the material is found to be stable, the region of stability, in terms of the constituent elemental chemical potentials, is determined from the intersection points of hypersurfaces in an (n\u22121)(n\u22121)-dimensional chemical potential space, where nn is the number of atomic species in the material. The input required is the free energy of formation of the material itself, and that of all competing phases. Output consists of the result of the test of stability, the intersection points in the chemical potential space and the competing phase to which they relate, and, for two- and three-dimensional spaces, a file which may be used for visualization of the stability region. We specify the use of the program by applying it both to a ternary system and to a quaternary system. The algorithm automates essential analysis of the thermodynamic stability of a material. This analysis consists of a process which is lengthy for ternary materials, and becomes much more complicated when studying materials of four or more constituent elements, which have become of increased interest in recent years for technological applications such as energy harvesting and optoelectronics. The algorithm will therefore be of great benefit to the theoretical and computational study of such materials.Program summaryProgram title: CPLAPCatalogue identifier: AEQO_v1_0Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEQO_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, N.

From this assumption derive a series of conditions on the elemental chemical potentials. Convert these conditions to a system of mm linear equations with nn unknowns, where m>nm>n. Solve all combinations of nn linear equations, and test which solutions are compatible with the conditions on the chemical potentials. If none are, the system is unstable. Otherwise, the compatible results define boundary points of the stability region within the space spanned by the chemical potentials.Restrictions:The material growth environment is assumed to be in thermal and diffusive equilibrium.Additional comments:For two- and three-dimensional spaces spanned by the chemical potentials, files are produced for visualization of the stability region (if it exists).Running time:Less than one second.",

    "abstract": "We present results of electronic structure calculations on the N-related localized vibrational modes in the dilute nitride alloy GaSb${}_{1\\ensuremath{-}x}$N${}_{x}$. By calculating the formation energies of various possible N incorporation modes in the alloy, we determine the most favorable N configurations, and we calculate their vibrational mode frequencies using density functional theory under the generalized gradient approximation to electron exchange and correlation, including the effects of the relativistic spin-orbit interactions. For a single N impurity, we find substitution on an Sb site, N${}_{\\mathrm{Sb}}$, to be most favorable, and for a two-N-atom complex, we find the N-N split interstitial on an Sb site to be most favorable. For these defects, as well as, for comparison, defects comprising two N atoms on neighboring Sb sites and a N-Sb split interstitial on an Sb site, we find well-localized vibration modes (LVMs), which should be experimentally observable. The frequency of the triply degenerate LVM associated with N${}_{\\mathrm{Sb}}$ is determined to be 427.6 cm${}^{\\ensuremath{-}1}$. Our results serve as a guide to future experimental studies to elucidate the incorporation of small concentrations of N in GaSb, which is known to lead to a reduction of the band gap and opens the possibility of using the material for long-wavelength applications.",

A segment of the nanowire (circa 50 atoms) is treated at a QM level of theory, using density functional theory (DFT) with a hybrid exchange-correlation functional. This segment is then embedded in a further length of wire, treated at an MM level of theory. The interaction between the QM and MM regions is provided by an embedding potential located at the interface. Point charges are placed beyond the ends of the wire segment in order to reproduce the Madelung potential of the infinite system. We test our model on the ideal system of a CdS linear chain, benchmarking our results against calculations performed on a periodic system using a plane-wave DFT approach, with electron exchange and correlation treated at the same level of approximation in both methods. We perform our tests on pure CdS and, importantly, the system containing a single In or Cu impurity. We find excellent agreement in the determined electronic structure using the two approaches, validating our embedded cluster model. As the hybrid QM/MM model avoids spurious interactions between charged defects, it will be of benefit to the analysis of the role of defects in nanowire materials, which is currently a major challenge using a plane-wave DFT approach. Other advantages of the hybrid QM/MM approach over plane-wave DFT include the ability to calculate ionization energies with an absolute reference and access to high levels of theory for the QM region which are not incorporated in most plane-wave codes. Our results concur with available experimental data.",

The steric bulk of the ligand controlled the stoichiometry of the resulting complexes. Thus, three new complexes, bearing one or two ancillary ligands, were prepared and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Reaction of the heteroleptic neodymium iodide complexes with amido groups yielded viable initiators for the ring-opening polymerization of lactide. The polymerizations were conducted using either the heteroleptic neodymium amido complexes or the in situ generated alkoxide complexes. Using such conditions, the neodymium complexes showed very fast and well-controlled polymerizations, with complete conversion being obtained in only a few minutes and yielding polylactide with controlled molecular weight and narrow polydispersity index. An initiating system comprising a rare neodymium-alkyl-carbene complex [Nd{C(PPh2NiPr)2}{CH(PPh2NiPr)2}] and externally added iPrOH was also an unexpected catalyst for the ROP of lactide.",

X-Ray analysis provides evidence for a square planar geometry without coordination of the chloride anion. These complexes proved to be air-sensitive, and their oxidation to Rh(III) complexes 3-X was observed in air. The controlled reaction of 2-BF4 with one equivalent of hexachloroethane yielded [Rh(P2N2)Cl2(BF4)] (3-BF4). Direct synthesis of 3-Cl can also be achieved by coordination of the [P2N2] ligand to [RhCl(THT)3] (THT = tetrahydrothiophene). The reactivity of Rh(I) complexes 2 was further investigated, and no reaction was observed with silanes, aryl halides, or pinacolborane, although decomposition was observed under 1 atm of H2 upon prolonged heating. Interestingly, reduction of complex 3-Cl was observed by NMR upon treatment with silanes or sodium isopropoxide. Therefore, complex 3-Cl was used for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of polar bonds. The reduction of aromatic and aliphatic ketones can be carried out using 1% catalyst and 10% sodium isopropoxide, while imines are partially reduced under these conditions.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Both cationic complexes adopt a square-planar geometry around the metal, all phosphorus and nitrogen atoms being coordinated. In contrast to most iminophosphorane complexes, 2 and 3 could be handled in water without any apparent decomposition. Their catalytic activity was evaluated in Suzuki\u2212Miyaura coupling. These reactions were conducted in toluene, water, or a biphasic toluene/water medium in the presence of a phase-transfer agent.

    "abstract": "We present results of density functional theory calculations on the phonon dispersion and elastic constants of bulk ceria (CeO${}_{2}$) as a function of positive and negative isotropic strain, which could be induced thermally or by cationic doping. We find that, as the lattice is expanded, there is a significant softening of the ${B}_{1u}$ mode at the $X$ point. This mode consists of motions of oxygens in the $[001]$ direction. At a strain of $1.6$$%$, corresponding to a temperature of 1600 K, the ${B}_{1u}$ and ${E}_{u}$ modes at the $X$ point cross, with an associated high, narrow peak in the phonon density of states appearing. We infer that this crossing indicates a coupling of the modes, leading to a transition to a superionic phase, where conductivity occurs in the $[001]$ direction, mediated by anion interstitial site occupation. As the lattice is expanded further, the ${B}_{1u}$ mode continues to soften, becoming imaginary at a strain of $3.4$$%$, corresponding to a temperature of 2500 K. Following the imaginary mode would result in a cubic to tetragonal phase transition, similar to those known to occur with reducing temperature in zirconia (ZrO${}_{2}$) and hafnia (HfO${}_{2}$). Our calculated elastic constants, however, indicate that the structure remains mechanically stable, even at this level of expansion. As confirmed by our semiclassical free energy calculations, the cubic phase of ceria remains the most stable, while the imaginary mode indicates a change to a thermally disordered cubic phase, with the majority of disorder occurring on the anion sublattice. Our results explain the high temperature ionic conductivity in ceria and other fluorite-structured materials in terms of the intrinsic lattice dynamics, and give insight to the stability and anionic disorder at elevated temperatures.",

( Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 931), shows high activity under just 1 bar pressure of CO2. This work applies in situ attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to study changes to the catalyst structure on reaction with cyclohexene oxide and, subsequently, with carbon dioxide. A computational investigation, using DFT with solvation corrections, is used to calculate the relative free energies for various transition states and intermediates in the cycle for alternating copolymerization catalyzed by this dinuclear complex. Two potentially competing side reactions, sequential epoxide enchainment and sequential carbon dioxide enchainment are also investigated. The two side-reactions are shown to be thermodynamically disfavored, rationalizing the high selectivity exhibited in experimental studies using 1. Furthermore, the DFT calculations show that the rate-determining step is the nucleophilic attack of the coordinated epoxide molecule by the zinc-bound carbonate group in line with previous experimental findings (\u0394\u0394G353 = 23.5 kcal/mol; \u0394G\u2021353 = 25.7 kcal/mol). Both in situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that just one polymer chain is initiated per dizinc catalyst molecule. The catalyst adopts a \u201cbowl\u201d shape conformation, whereby the acetate group coordinated on the concave face is a spectator ligand while that coordinated on the convex face is the initiating group. The spectator carboxylate group plays an important role in the catalytic cycle, counter-balancing chain growth on the opposite face. The DFT was used to predict the activities of two new catalysts, good agreement between experimental turn-over-numbers and DFT predictions were observed.",

    "abstract": "This review describes the application of organometallic and inorganic complexes as initiators and catalysts for polymerizations using renewable resources. It focuses on the ring-opening polymerization of lactide and the alternating copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides. For lactide ring-opening polymerization, a general background to the reaction mechanism, kinetics, stereochemical control and polymerization control is presented. This is followed by reviews of the use of groups 3 and 13 complexes as initiators. Group 3 complexes show excellent rates, amongst the fastest reported for this polymerization, and in some cases stereocontrol. The group 13 complexes have good precedent for stereocontrol; recent advances using heavier group 13 elements, In and Ga, are highlighted. For the alternating copolymerization, an overview of the reaction kinetics, mechanism and control is presented. Recent advances in the use of catalyst operating at low pressure and dinuclear catalysts are presented.",

Several series of its derivatives with various linker systems between the steroid sulfatase (STS) and the aromatase inhibitory pharmacophores were synthesised and evaluated in JEG-3 cells. The X-ray crystal structures of the aromatase inhibitors, DASI precursors 42\u2009d and 60, and DASI 43\u2009h were determined. Nearly all derivatives show improved in\u2005vitro aromatase inhibition over 6\u2009a but decreased STS inhibition. The best aromatase inhibitor is 42\u2009e (IC50=0.26\u2005nM) and the best DASI is 43\u2009e (IC50\u2009aromatase=0.45\u2005nM, IC50\u2009STS=1200\u2005nM). SAR for aromatase inhibition shows that compounds containing an alkylene- and thioether-based linker system are more potent than those that are ether-, sulfone-, or sulfonamide-based, and that the length of the linker has a limited effect on aromatase inhibition beyond two methylene units. Compounds 43\u2009d\u2013f were studied in\u2005vivo (10\u2005mg\u2009kg\u22121, single, p.o.). The most potent DASI is 43\u2009e, which inhibited PMSG-induced plasma estradiol levels by 92\u2009% and liver STS activity by 98\u2009% 3\u2005h after dosing. These results further strengthen the concept of designing and developing DASIs for potential treatment of hormone-related cancers.",

The reaction of H2L with cobalt(II) and nickel(II) nitrates at room temperature in basic DMF/H2O solution gave discrete mononuclear coordination complexes with the general formula {[M(HL)2(H2O)4]\u00b72DMF} (M = Co (1), Ni (2)), whereas the reaction with zinc(II) nitrate gave [Zn(HL)2]\u221e, 3, a coordination polymer with distorted diamondoid topology and fourfold interpenetration. Coordination about the tetrahedral Zn(II) nodes in 3 are furnished by two pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms to give a mixed N2O2 donor set. Isotopological coordination polymers of zinc(II), {[Zn(HL)2]\u00b72CH3OH\u00b7H2O}\u221e, 4, and cobalt(II), [Co(HL)2]\u221e, 5, are formed when the reactions are carried out under solvothermal conditions in methanol (80 \u00b0C) and water (180 \u00b0C), respectively. The reaction of H2L with cadmium(II) nitrate at room temperature in methanol gives {[Cd(HL)2(MeOH)2]\u00b71.8MeOH}\u221e6, a 2-D (4,4)-connected coordination polymer, whereas with copper(II) the formation of green crystals that transform into purple crystals is observed. The metastable green phase [Cu3(HL)4(\u03bc2-SO4)(H2O)3]\u221e, 7, crystallises with conserved binding domains of the heteroditopic ligand and contains two different metal nodes: a dicopper carboxylate paddle wheel motif, and, a dicopper unit bridged by sulfate ions and coordinated by ligand pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms. The resultant purple phase {[Cu(HL)2]\u00b74CH3OH\u00b7H2O}\u221e, 8, however, has single copper ion nodes coordinated by mixed N2O2 donor sets with trans-square planar geometry and is threefold interpenetrated. The desolvation of 8 was followed by powder X-ray diffraction and single crystal X-ray diffraction which show desolvation induces the transition to a more closely packed structure while the coordination geometry about the copper ions and the network topology is retained. Powder X-ray diffraction and microanalysis were used to characterise the bulk purity of the coordination materials 1\u20136 and 8. The thermal characteristics of 1\u20132, 4\u20136 and 8 were studied by TG-DTA. This led to the curious observation of small exothermic events in networks 4, 6, and 8 that appear to be linked to their decomposition. In addition, the solid state structures of H2L and that of its protonated salt, H2L\u00b7HNO3, were also determined and revealed that H2L forms a 2-D hydrogen bonded polymer incorporating helical chains formed through N\u2013H\u22efO and O\u2013H\u22efN interactions, and that [H3L]NO3 forms a 1-D hydrogen-bonded polymer.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

C-2 Substitution and 17-sulfamate replacement of the estradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamates were explored with efficient and practical syntheses developed. Evaluation against human cancer cell lines revealed the 2-methyl derivative 27 (DU145 GI50 = 0.38 \u03bcM) as the most active novel bis-sulfamate, while 2-ethyl-17-carbamate derivative 52 (GI50 = 0.22 \u03bcM) proved most active of its series (cf. 2-ethylestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate 4 GI50 = 0.21 \u03bcM). Larger C-2 substituents were deleterious to activity. 2-Methoxy-17-carbamate 50 was studied by X-ray crystallography and was surprisingly 13-fold weaker as an STS inhibitor compared to parent bis-sulfamate 3. The potential of 4 as an orally dosed anti-tumor agent is confirmed using breast and prostate cancer xenografts. In the MDA-MB-231 model, dramatic reduction in tumor growth or regression was observed, with effects sustained after cessation of treatment. 3-O-Sulfamoylated 2-alkylestradiol-17-O-carbamates and sulfamates have considerable potential as anticancer agents.

    "abstract": " The design, synthesis, structure, and anion-binding properties of the first indolocarbazole-containing interlocked structure are described. The novel [2]rotaxane molecular structure incorporates a neutral indolocarbazole-containing axle component which is encircled by a tetracationic macrocycle functionalized with an isophthalamide anion recognition motif. 1H NMR and UV\u2212visible spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography demonstrated the importance of \u03c0-donor\u2212acceptor, CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0, and electrostatic interactions in the assembly of pseudorotaxanes between the electron-deficient tetracationic macrocycle and a series of \u03c0-electron-rich indolocarbazole derivatives. Subsequent urethane stoppering of one of these complexes afforded a [2]rotaxane, which was shown by 1H NMR spectroscopic titration experiments to exhibit enhanced chloride and bromide anion recognition compared to its non-interlocked components. Computational molecular dynamics simulations provide further insight into the mechanism and structural nature of the anion recognition process, confirming it to involve cooperative hydrogen-bond donation from both macrocycle and indolocarbazole components of the rotaxane. The observed selectivity of the [2]rotaxane for chloride is interpreted in terms of its unique interlocked binding cavity, defined by the macrocycle isophthalamide and indolocarbazole N\u2212H protons, which is complementary in size and shape to this halide guest.",

    "abstract": "The performance of perovskite solar cells recently exceeded 15% solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency for small-area devices. The fundamental properties of the active absorber layers, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites formed from mixing metal and organic halides [e.g., (NH4)PbI3 and (CH3NH3)PbI3], are largely unknown. The materials are semiconductors with direct band gaps at the boundary of the first Brillouin zone. The calculated dielectric constants and band gaps show an orientation dependence, with a low barrier for rotation of the organic cations. Due to the electric dipole of the methylammonium cation, a photoferroic effect may be accessible, which could enhance carrier collection.",

The force field describes the periodic crystal and considers effective atomic charges based on topological analysis of the Bloch states of the extended materials. Transferable potentials were developed for the four organic ligands comprising the test set and for the associated Cu, Zn, and Zr metal nodes. The predicted materials properties, including bulk moduli and vibrational frequencies, are in agreement with explicit density functional theory calculations.

Homonuclear intervalence charge transfer energies between both FeIII/FeII and TiIV/TiIII species have also been calculated, with the energy lying in the infra-red region.

    "abstract": "AbstractIt is recognised that point defects play a key role in the behaviour and properties of many technologically significant oxides. What is less well understood is how these defects cluster together and, crucially, the extent to which the clusters change with composition. We chose to investigate this phenomenon by considering UO2, a nuclear fuel material for which there is contradictory data in the literature concerning defect clustering as a function of oxygen content. Early studies of fluorite UO2+x proposed a model based on 2:2:2 Willis clusters whilst more recent research suggests cuboctahedral or split quad-interstitial defect clustering. Here we use the PBE\u00a0+\u00a0U functional to simulate defective UO2+x and find for 0.125\u00a0<\u00a0x\u00a0<\u00a00.25, chains of edge-sharing 2:2:2 Willis clusters to be most stable.

    "abstract": "Uranium trioxide (UO3) is known to adopt a variety of crystalline and amorphous phases. Here we applied the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof functional + U formalism to predict structural, electronic, and elastic properties of five experimentally determined UO3 polymorphs, in addition to their relative stability. The simulations reveal that the methodology is well-suited to describe the different polymorphs. We found better agreement with experiment for simpler phases where all bonds are similar (\u03b1- and \u03b4-), while some differences are seen for those with more complex bonding (\u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b7-), which we address in terms of the disorder and defective nature of the experimental samples. Our calculations also predict the presence of uranyl bonds to affect the elastic and electronic properties. Phases containing uranyl bonds tend to have smaller band gaps and bulk moduli under 100 GPa contrary to those without uranyl bonds, which have larger band gaps and bulk moduli greater than 150 GPa. In line with experimental observations, we predict the most thermodynamically stable polymorph as \u03b3-UO3, the least stable as \u03b1-UO3, and the most stable at high pressure as \u03b7-UO3.",

In the majority of cases, cyclization of alkynyl alcohols produces mixtures of the possible endo- and exocyclic enol ether products, rationalized as a consequence of alkynylalkoxide isomerization to the corresponding allene derivatives. Cyclization rates for terminal alkynyl alcohols were found to be significantly higher than for substrates bearing internal alkynyl substituents, while the efficacy of cyclization was in general found to be determined by a combination of stereoelectronic influences and the thermochemical viability of the specific alkaline earth metal catalysis, which we suggest is determined by the individual M\u2013O bond strengths. Kinetic studies have provided a rate law pertaining to a pronounced catalyst inhibition with increasing [substrate], indicating that turnover-limiting insertion of C\u2013C unsaturation into the M\u2013O bond requires the dissociation of substrate molecules away from the Lewis acidic alkaline earth center.",

Initial studies revealed that the amide precatalysts, 1 and 2, while compromised in terms of absolute activity by a tendency toward transaminative behavior, offer greater stability toward polymerization/oligomerization side reactions. In every case the strontium species, 2 and 4, were found to outperform their calcium congeners. Reactions of piperidine with para-substituted styrenes are indicative of rate-determining alkene insertion in the catalytic cycle while the ease of addition of secondary cyclic amines was found to be dependent on ring size and reasoned to be a consequence of varying amine nucleophilicity. Hydroamination of conjugated dienes yielded isomeric products via \u03b73-allyl intermediates and their relative distributions were explained through stereoelectronic considerations. The ability to carry out the hydroamination of internal alkynes was found to be dramatically dependent upon the identity of the alkyne substituents while reactions employing terminal alkynes resulted in the precipitation of insoluble and unreactive group 2 acetylides. The rate law for styrene hydroamination with piperidine catalyzed by [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}2]2 was deduced to be first order in [amine] and [alkene] and second order in [catalyst], while large kinetic isotope effects and group 2 element-dependent \u0394S\u29e7 values implicated the formation of an amine-assisted rate-determining alkene insertion transition state in which there is a considerable entropic advantage associated with use of the larger strontium center.",

The behavior of the three complexes upon irradiation is generally similar, but some subtle differences have been observed. From the crystallographic studies all three complexes 1\u20133 exhibit the endo-nitrito linkage isomer upon irradiation, however, for 3# (a crystal structure that contains components of both 3 and 3#O) an exo-nitrito isomer is also observed. Under conditions of 90\u2013100 K, with blue light, the conversion percentages to the nitrito isomers, 1#O, 2#O and 3#O were 16%, 22% and 30%, respectively. At temperatures below 110 K all three nitrito isomers were stable for over four hours but while 2#O and 3#O could be detected at temperatures down to 30 K, at temperatures below 60 K the metastable structure 1#O appeared to be quenched and only the nitro isomer 1 was identified in the crystal.

Complex 1 has been synthesised and fully photophysically characterised by (resonance) Raman and transient absorption spectroscopy complemented by calculations. The ring-closing photoconversion in a single crystal of 1 has been followed by X-ray crystallography. This process occurs with the extremely high yield of 80\u2009%\u2014considerably outperforming the other DTE derivatives. Remarkably, the photocyclisation of 1 occurs even under visible light (>400\u2005nm), which is not absorbed by the non-metallated DTE core HCC(DTE)CCH (2) itself. This unusual behaviour and the high photocyclisation yields in solution are attributed to the presence of a heavy atom in 1 that enables a triplet-sensitised photocyclisation pathway, elucidated by transient absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The results of resonance Raman investigation confirm the involvement of the alkynyl unit in the frontier orbitals of both closed and open forms of 1 in the photocyclisation process. The changes in the Raman spectra upon cyclisation have permitted the identification of Raman marker bands, which include the acetylide stretching vibration. Importantly, these bands occur in the spectral region unobstructed by other vibrations and can be used for non-destructive monitoring of photocyclisation/photoreversion processes and for optical readout in this type of efficiently photochromic thermally stable systems. This study indicates a strategy for generating efficient solid-state photoswitches in which modification of the PtII units has the potential to tune absorption properties and hence operational wavelength across the visible range.",

These properties are, in many cases, present in the same material, providing the intriguing prospect of a material that can harvest energy from multiple sources including vibration, thermal fluctuations and light. Piezoelectric materials are initially discussed in the context of harvesting mechanical energy from vibrations using inertial energy harvesting, which relies on the resistance of a mass to acceleration, and kinematic energy harvesting which directly couples the energy harvester to the relative movement of different parts of a source. Issues related to mode of operation, loss mechanisms and using non-linearity to enhance the operating frequency range are described along with the potential materials that could be employed for harvesting vibrations at elevated temperatures. In addition to inorganic piezoelectric materials, compliant piezoelectric materials are also discussed. Piezoelectric energy harvesting devices are complex multi-physics systems requiring advanced methodologies to maximise their performance. The research effort to develop optimisation methods for complex piezoelectric energy harvesters is then reviewed. The use of ferroelectric or multi-ferroic materials to convert light into chemical or electrical energy is then described in applications where the internal electric field can prevent electron\u2013hole recombination or enhance chemical reactions at the ferroelectric surface. Finally, pyroelectric harvesting generates power from temperature fluctuations and this review covers the modes of pyroelectric harvesting such as simple resistive loading and Olsen cycles. Nano-scale pyroelectric systems and novel micro-electro-mechanical-systems designed to increase the operating frequency are discussed.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

Reaction of 4a/b with Et3N\u00b73HF gave only the trans-P,P isomer of the bifluoride complex Rh(6-Me)(PPh3)2(FHF) (6b), whereas 5a/b reacted to form Rh(6-Et)(PPh3)2(FHF) as a mixture of cis- and trans-phosphine isomers (7a/b).

It could be shown that these compounds are able to act as efficient initiators for lactide polymerisation, and polylactides with molecular weights (Mw) of around 23,000\u201355,000\u00a0g/mol could be obtained with relatively narrow polydispersities. 1 and 2 exhibit an advantageous combination of robustness towards humidity and high activity in the polymer melt. A comparative DFT study on 1 and 2 and their guanidine counterparts revealed that the two complex series possess a strikingly similar electronic structure. Although the imidazolin-2-imine is more basic, its zinc complexes have only a slightly greater positive charge on the zinc atom in comparison to the corresponding guanidine complexes. Accordingly, their activity in the initiation of the ring-opening polymerisation is increased which is directly related to the Lewis acidity of the zinc atom. These findings allow more insights into the mechanism of the lactide polymerisation with neutral N-donor stabilised zinc complexes.",

Similarly, the constants for the formation binary complexes of the three boronic acids with (hydrogen) phosphate, (hydrogen) citrate, or imidazole were determined. Finally, the formation of ternary complexes of the boronic acids, phosphate, citrate or imidazole, and the saccharides were determined based on the determined values of the binary complexes. The previously unrecognized ternary complexes are significant in all systems investigated, and under some solution compositions, they can be the dominant species in solution over a wide pH range. A value of 15\u201325\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 was determined for the energy of the B\u2013N interaction in the benzylmethyl derivative based on the relative stabilities of the ternary phosphate complexes of the three boronic acids.

Pure cellulose and cellulose composite films are obtained in a solvent evaporation process. A boronic acid appended dendrimer is embedded as a receptor in the nanofibrillar cellulose membrane. The number of boronic acid binding sites is controlled by varying the dendrimer content. The electrochemical and spectrophotometric properties of the nanocomposite membrane are investigated using the probe molecule alizarin red S. Pure cellulose membranes inhibit access to the electrode. However, the presence of boronic acid receptor sites allows accumulation of alizarin red S with a Langmuirian binding constant of ca. 6000 \u00b1 1000 M\u22121. The 2-electron 2-proton reduction of immobilized alizarin red S is shown to occur in a ca. 60 nm zone close to the electrode surface. With a boronic acid dendrimer modified nanofibrillar cellulose composition of 96 wt% cellulose and 4 wt% boronic acid dendrimer, the analytical range for alizarin red S in aqueous acetate buffer pH 3 is approximately 10 \u00b5M to 1 mM.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": " A strategy for the formation of thin reconstituted cellulose films (pure or modified)) with embedded receptors or embedded ion-selective components is reported. Cellulose nanofibril ribbons from sisal of typically 3\u22125 nm diameter and 250 nm length are reconstituted into thin films of typically 1.5\u22122.0 \u03bcm thickness (or into thicker free-standing films). Cellulose and cellulose nanocomposite films are obtained in a simple solvent evaporation process. Poly-(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) or PDDAC is readily embedded into the cellulose film and imparts anion permselectivity to allow binding and transport of hydrophobic anions. The number of binding sites is controlled by the amount of PDDAC present in the film. The electrochemical properties of the cellulose films are investigated first for the Fe(CN)63-/4- model redox system and then for the accumulation and detection of triclosan (2,4,4\u2018-trichloro-2\u2018-hydroxydiphenyl ether, a hydrophobic polychlorinated phenol). Pure nanocellulose thin films essentially block the access to the electrode surface for anions such as Fe(CN)63- and Fe(CN)64-. In contrast, in the presence of cellulose\u2212PDDAC films, accumulation and transport of both Fe(CN)63- and Fe(CN)64- in electrostatic binding sites occurs (Langmuirian binding constants for both are about 1.2 \u00d7 104 mol-1 dm3 in aqueous 0.1 M KCl). Facile reduction/oxidation at the electrode surface is observed. Triclosan, a widely used antifungal and antibacterial polychlorinated phenol is similarly accumulated into cationic binding sites (Langmuirian binding constant about 2.1 \u00d7 104 mol-1 dm3 in aqueous 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 9.5) and is shown to give well-defined oxidation responses at glassy carbon electrodes. With a cellulose\u2212PDDAC film electrode (80 wt % cellulose and 20 wt % PDDAC), the analytical range for triclosan in aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 9.5 is about 10-6\u221210-3 mol dm-3.  ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe reaction between nickel(II) nitrate and potassium phosphorus-1,1-dithiolates (di-sec-butyl and di-iso-butyl) in methanol yields 2:1 complexes which were characterized by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. 2:1 pyrazole adducts of both compounds were also obtained.The X-ray diffraction analysis of the compounds reveals square planar, four-coordination geometry for the homoleptic compounds and a six-coordinated distorted octahedral geometry for the adducts. In Ni[S2P(OBus)2]2 the molecules are associated through C\u2013H\u00e2\u008b\u00afO hydrogen bonds (2.652 \u00c5), and in Ni[S2P(OBui)2]2 the molecules are associated through C\u2013H\u00e2\u008b\u00afS hydrogen bonds (2.948\u00a0\u00c5). The pyrazole adducts are associated through N\u2013H\u00e2\u008b\u00afO bonds and N\u2013H\u00e2\u008b\u00afS bonds from the pyrazole nitrogen atoms, to form supramolecular assemblies.

This led to the development of MFC-inspired photovoltaic (BPV) devices that produce electrical power by harvesting solar energy through biological activities of photosynthetic organisms. We describe the fabrication of a BPV device with multiple microchannels. This allows a direct comparison between sub-cellular photosynthetic organelles and whole cells, and quantitative analysis of the parameters affecting power output. Electron transfer within the photosynthetic materials was studied using the metabolic inhibitors DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) and methyl viologen (1,1\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\u2032-bipyridinium dichloride).

Currently power outputs from BPVs are generally low and suffer from low efficiencies. However, a better understanding of the electrochemical interactions between the microbes and conductive materials will be likely to lead to increased power yields. In the current study, the fresh-water, filamentous cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena limnetica (also known as Oscillatoria limnetica) was investigated for exoelectrogenic activity. Biofilms of P. limnetica showed a significant photo response during light\u2013dark cycling in BPVs under mediatorless conditions. A multi-channel BPV device was developed to compare quantitatively the performance of photosynthetic biofilms of this species using a variety of different anodic conductive materials: indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO), stainless steel (SS), glass coated with a conductive polymer (PANI), and carbon paper (CP). Although biofilm growth rates were generally comparable on all materials tested, the amplitude of the photo response and achievable maximum power outputs were significantly different. ITO and SS demonstrated the largest photo responses, whereas CP showed the lowest power outputs under both light and dark conditions. Furthermore, differences in the ratios of light:dark power outputs indicated that the electrochemical interactions between photosynthetic microbes and the anode may differ under light and dark conditions depending on the anodic material used. Comparisons between BPV performances and material characteristics revealed that surface roughness and surface energy, particularly the ratio of non-polar to polar interactions (the CQ ratio), may be more important than available surface area in determining biocompatibility and maximum power outputs in microbial electrochemical systems. Notably, CP was readily outperformed by all other conductive materials tested, indicating that carbon may not be an optimal substrate for microbial fuel cell operation.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

These compounds have been characterized by using various techniques including 1H NMR and IR spectroscopies and electrospray mass spectrometry. UV\u2013vis absorption spectra recorded in acetonitrile are dominated by intense, low energy \u00cf\u0080\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u00cf\u0080* intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) bands, and replacing Me with Ph increases the ICT energies. Cyclic voltammetric studies show irreversible reduction processes, together with oxidation waves that are irreversible for R\u00a0=\u00a0Me, but reversible for R\u00a0=\u00a0Ph. Single crystal X-ray structures have been determined for three of the methyl ester-substituted stilbazolium salts and for the Cl\u2212 salts of their picolinium precursors. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations afford reasonable predictions of ICT energies, but greater rigour is necessary for \u2013NPh2 derivatives. The four new acid-functionalized dyes give moderate sensitization efficiencies (ca. 0.2%) when using TiO2-based photoanodes, with relatively higher values for R\u00a0=\u00a0Ph vs Me, while larger efficiencies (up to 0.8%) are achieved with ZnO substrates.",

Characterisation involved various techniques including 1H NMR spectroscopy and +electrospray or MALDI mass spectrometry. The UV\u2013Vis spectra display intense intraligand \u00cf\u0080\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u00cf\u0080\u2217 absorptions, and also metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) bands with two resolved maxima in the visible region. Red-shifts in the MLCT bands occur as the electron-withdrawing strength of the pyridinium groups increases, while replacing Cl\u2212 with NCS\u2212 causes blue-shifts. Cyclic voltammograms show quasi-reversible or reversible RuIII/II oxidation waves, and several ligand-based reductions that are irreversible. The variations in the redox potentials correlate with changes in the MLCT energies. A single-crystal X-ray structure has been obtained for a protonated form of a proligand salt, [(4-(CO2H)Ph)2qpyH3+][HSO4]3\u00b73H2O. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations give adequate correlations with the experimental UV\u2013Vis spectra for the two carboxylic acid-functionalised complexes in DMSO. Despite their attractive electronic absorption spectra, these dyes are relatively inefficient photosensitisers on electrodes coated with TiO2 or ZnO. These observations are attributed primarily to weak electronic coupling with the surfaces, since the DFT-derived LUMOs include no electron density near the carboxylic acid anchors.",

Providing sufficient contact area between phases easily overcomes the physical limitations associated with the phase transfer of species, facilitating its scale-up, recyclability of the catalyst and easing product separation. Using the epoxidation of sunflower seed oil as a model reaction, we have also shown how the chemical and safety limitations associated with the parallel decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by Na2WO4 can be suppressed by the use of readily available water soluble organic carboxylic acids and careful consideration of the catalyst to acid ratio.

The amplitude of each path varies as a function of the mean square variation in path length. This quantity depends on the many-body correlations involving atoms in the path, as well as the mean square displacement of individual atoms. The correlations normal as well as parallel to interatomic vectors are required, and the effects of anharmonicity must be taken into account. Although difficult to calculate accurately, these quantities can be extracted directly from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we present temperature dependent results for copper, using a semiempirical potential based on a tight-binding model, from which the cumulants of the variation in path length as well as the correlation functions are derived.

    "abstract": " A method has been developed which allows the simultaneous refinement of X-ray powder diffraction data and one or more EXAFS spectra from the same sample using a single set of coordinates to describe the structure. The atomic positions are refined together with isotropic thermal factors, peak shape and amplitude parameters, and the EXAFS energy zeros for each absorption edge. The program determines the point symmetry and radial coordinates of each site occupied by an atom for which EXAFS data are available, allowing a full multiple scattering calculation to be performed for each site. Mixed or partial occupancy of sites is permitted. Where correlations between atoms can be calculated, as with copper for which Debye theory can be used, EXAFS mean-square displacements can be derived from the isotropic thermal factors, otherwise either the correlations or the EXAFS mean-square relative displacements must be introduced as separate variables. The method potentially allows us to accurately determine the position of oxygen and other light atoms in materials where the diffraction pattern is dominated by heavy atoms, and to determine the occupancy of sites where elements of similar scattering amplitude are involved. Results are particularly good where the EXAFS of several absorbing atoms are available.  ",

Electron tomography conducted at high magnification with lattice resolved imaging is combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy revealing oxidation states of Ce ions. It is found that extended {100} faces exist predominantly without local nanofaceting, except for {111} corner caps and subfacets on {110} edges. Reduced Ce is found on all {100} surfaces, while Sm doping does not lower the reduced Ce concentration.

This chemically selective technique generates high-resolution 3D images, from which semi-quantitative information may be elucidated. Ibuprofen, applied as a close-to-saturated solution in propylene glycol, was directly observed to crystallise in/on the skin, as the co-solvent permeated more rapidly, resulting in precipitation of the drug. Coherent Raman scattering microscopy is also an excellent tool, in conjunction with more conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy, with which to image micro/nanoparticle-based formulations. Specifically, the uptake of particles into thermal ablation transport pathways in the skin has been examined.",

While the strontium derivatives of reactions with dimethylamine and pyrrolidine borane are stable and isolable compounds, the analogous magnesium and calcium compounds are found to be unstable at room temperature. Studies of the thermolysis of the alkylstrontium derivatives have allowed this instability to be rationalised as a result of \u03b2-hydride elimination, the facility of which varies with changing M2+ charge density, to form the products of M\u2013C insertion of H2BNR2. Subsequent to this process, alkylaminoboranes, [HB(NR2){CH(SiMe3)2}], are observed to form through a further suggested \u03b2-hydride elimination reaction. This chemistry is also extended to the reaction of the primary amine borane tBuNH2\u00b7BH3 with [Sr{CH(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2]. In this case the crystal structure of a heteroleptic species, which may be considered as a tetrameric aggregate of two [Sr{CH(SiMe3)2}{(NHtBu)BH3}2] anions and two cationic [Sr{(NHtBu)(BH3)}(THF)2] components, has been determined. Kinetic studies of the reactions of [M{CH(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Mg, Ca, Sr) with dimethylamine borane have also been undertaken and describe a complex mechanism in which the barriers to formation of the various intermediate species are a consequence of M2+ radius and resultant charge density as well as the steric demands of the coordinated amidoborane ligands.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "The primary amine\u2013borane t-BuNH2\u00b7BH3 reacts with a \u03b2-diketiminate-supported silylamido calcium complex with elimination of HN(SiMe3)2 and formation of the corresponding primary amidoborane complex, in which the deprotonated amine\u2013borane is attached to the alkaline-earth center via its nitrogen atom and anagostic interactions with the boron-bound hydrides. Catalytic dehydrocoupling reactions employed with this \u03b2-diketiminate precatalyst are found to be slow and complicated by protonation of the supporting ligand and the formation of a number of boron-containing products, all of which have been positively identified. In common with previous studies of group 2 catalyzed secondary amine\u2013borane dehydrogenation, the first formed major product of the catalysis is identified by solution NMR and solid-state single-crystal X-ray studies to be a cyclic diborazane, [HtBuN\u2013BH2]2, the formation of which is accompanied by variable proportions of diamidoborane and aminoborane products. The active calcium species is also observed to be depleted during the catalysis due to the formation of hydrocarbon-insoluble [Ca(BH4)2\u00b7THF]\u221e, which has also been structurally characterized. Continued heating of these reaction mixtures results in the formation of cyclic trimeric 1,3,5-tri-tert-butylborazine, which is proposed to form through the intermediacy of [HtBuN\u2013BH2]2 by an, as yet, undefined sequence of borazane dehydrogenation and ring expansion reactions.",

By contrast, the equivalent reactions with copper bromide, either solvent free or in 1,2-dichloroethane, in the presence or absence of palladium, under air or inert conditions, gave the products of simple electrophilic bromination. Mechanistic studies highlighted the involvement of palladacyclic intermediates, one of which was characterised crystallographically, which undergo subsequent reaction with copper(II) chloride to yield the chlorinated anilide products.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

The nomenclature used in the chapter commonly uses the word endings inine to denote a six-member heterocyclic ring, which is fully unsaturated or \u2013inane to denote fully saturated. The precedence of heteroatom numbering is oxygen > sulfur > nitrogen > phosphorus > silicon > germanium > boron > gallium. The chapter attempts to use a systematic nomenclature, unless the names are in common usage, where the both names appear in the section heading. The structure of reactions and synthesis for the compounds and the chemistry involved are discussed and provided for the reader.",

The reaction product has been studied by magnetometry, neutron diffraction and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy over the temperature range 1.8 \u2264 T/K \u2264 700. The electronic structure and magnetic coupling have been modelled by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo methods. Fe2GeMo3N adopts the cubic \u03b7-carbide structure with a = 11.1630(1) \u00c5 at 300 K. The electrical resistivity was found to be \u223c0.9 m\u03a9 cm over the temperature range 80 \u2264 T/K \u2264 300. On cooling below 455 K the compound undergoes a transition from a paramagnetic to an antiferromagnetic state. The magnetic unit cell contains an antiferromagnetic arrangement of eight ferromagnetic Fe4 tetrahedra; the ordered atomic magnetic moments, 1.90(4) \u03bcB per Fe atom at 1.8 K, align along a <111> direction. DFT predicts an ordered moment of 1.831 \u03bcB per Fe. A random phase approximation to the DFT parameterised Heisenberg model yields a N\u00e9el temperature of 549 K, whereas the value of 431 K is obtained in the classical limit for spin. Monte Carlo calculations confirm that the experimentally determined magnetic structure is the lowest-energy antiferromagnetic structure, but with a lower N\u00e9el temperature of 412 K. These results emphasise the potential of these computational methods in the search for new magnetic materials.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Galleria mellonella infection model was used to assess the in vivo efficacy of phage therapy against laboratory and clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a first series of experiments, Galleria were infected with the laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 and were treated with varying multiplicity of infection (MOI) of phages either 2\u00a0h post-infection (treatment) or 2\u00a0h pre-infection (prevention) via injection into the haemolymph. To address the kinetics of infection, larvae were bled over a period of 24\u00a0h for quantification of bacteria and phages. Survival rates at 24\u00a0h when infected with 10 cells/larvae were greater in the prevention versus treatment model (47% vs. 40%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a010; 47% vs. 20%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a01; and 33% vs. 7%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a00.1). This pattern held true when 100 cells/larvae were used (87% vs. 20%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a010; 53% vs. 13%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a01; 67% vs. 7%, MOI\u00a0=\u00a00.1). By 24\u00a0h post-infection, phages kept bacterial cell numbers in the haemolymph 1000-fold lower than in the non-treated group. In a second series of experiments using clinical strains to further validate the prevention model, phages protected Galleria when infected with both a bacteraemia (0% vs. 85%) and a cystic fibrosis (80% vs. 100%) isolate. Therefore, this study validates the use of G. mellonella as a simple, robust and cost-effective model for initial in vivo examination of P. aeruginosa-targeted phage therapy, which may be applied to other pathogens with similarly low infective doses.",

    "abstract": "The use of hydrogels as safe, biocompatible materials for wound healing has been widely utilized in recent years. Here, we investigated the use of a composite hydrogel to impart a \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism into an antimicrobial hydrogel system. The system was comprised of a bilayer hydrogel architecture: a lower agarose layer containing the antimicrobial virus Bacteriophage K (\u03a6K) and an upper layer formed of photo-cross-linkable hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) which creates the hydrogel trigger. This trigger is sensitive to the enzyme hyaluronidase, an enzyme known to be secreted by the majority of Staphylococcus aureus strains. In the presence of hyaluronidase, HAMA is degraded, releasing \u03a6K into the surrounding environment which consequently go on to kill surrounding bacteria. Our results show that on incubation with hyaluronidase (purified or from S. aureus), large pores form in HAMA as degradation goes on, which facilitates \u03a6K release.",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) has been used successfully for the characterization of biomolecules in proteomics in the last few years. This methodology relied largely on the use of reversed-phase chromatography, in particular C18-based resins, which are suitable for separation of peptides. Here we show that polymeric [polystyrene divinylbenzene] monolithic columns can be used to separate peptide mixtures faster and at a higher resolution. For 500\u2009fmol bovine serum albumin, up to 68% sequence coverage and Mascot Mowse scores of >2000 were obtained using a 9\u2009min gradient on a monolithic column coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer with ultra-fast MS/MS scan rates. In order to achieve similar results using C18 columns, it was necessary to extend gradient times to 30\u2009min. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for the analysis of whole Escherichia coli cell lysates by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE) in combination with LC/MS/MS using 4\u2009min gradients on monolithic columns. Our results indicate higher throughput capabilities of monolithic columns (3-fold gain in time or more) for conventional proteomics applications, such as protein identification and high sequence coverage usually required for detection of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Further optimization of sensitivity and quality of sequence information is discussed, in particular when combined with mass spectrometers that have very fast MS-MS/MS switching and scanning capabilities.

    "abstract": "AbstractA study aimed at determining the time necessary for an alkyd paint to attain chemical curing is presented. In particular, the object of our investigation was an oil paint made by Winsor & Newton, namely French ultramarine (PB29) in the Griffin Alkyd \u201cfast drying oil colour\u201d series. Using this paint, we prepared several mock-ups on glass. These were left in the laboratory at room temperature in a piece of furniture with glass doors for a total of 70\u00a0days. Samples were taken at different times, and the changes in their composition were monitored by means of FT-IR and multinuclear NMR spectroscopic analyses. Since the cross-linking reactions involved in the formation of the pictorial film mainly affect the amount of carbon\u2013carbon double bonds, we monitored the decrease in allyl, diallyl and vinyl protons and carbons. The data obtained from the use of both techniques led us to conclude that, in our particular experimental conditions, the chemical curing of the paint layer is reached within the first 70\u00a0days, thus establishing the beginning of the ageing phenomena.",

Further reactions of the free amidine [{(2-FC6H4)N}C(NHiPr)2] with either [Ca{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] or its dimeric unsolvated analogue provided monomeric or dimeric derivatives respectively in which the ligands had tautomerised to an anisobidentate form. A further reaction of the phosphaguanidine [CyNC(PPh2)N(H)Cy] with [Sr{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] provided the first example of a phosphaguanidinate complex of this heavier alkaline earth metal.

    "abstract": " A series of triazenide complexes of the heavier alkaline earths, Ca, Sr and Ba, have been synthesized by either protonolysis or salt metathesis routes. Although complexes of the form [{Ar2N3}M{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)n] (M = Ca, n = 2; M = Sr, n = 3; Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and [{Ar2N3}Ca(I)(THF)2]2 could be isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography, solution studies revealed the propensity of these species to undergo Schlenk-like redistribution with the formation of [{Ar2N3}2M(THF)n] (M = Ca, n = 1; M = Sr, n = 2). The latter compounds have been synthesized independently. In the case of the large barium dication, attempts to synthesize the heaviest analogue of the series, [{Ar2N3}2Ba(THF)n], failed and led instead to the isolation of the potassium barate complex [K{Ar2N3}Ba{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)4]. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies demonstrated that, although in all the aforementioned cases the triazenide ligand binds to the electrophilic group 2 metal centers via symmetrical \u03ba2-N,N-chelates, in the latter compound an unprecedented bridging mode is observed in which the triazenide ligand coordinates through both terminal and internal nitrogen centers. A series of density-functional theory computational experiments have been undertaken to assist in our understanding of this phenomenon. In further experiments, the calcium and strontium amide derivatives [{Ar2N3}M{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)n] (M = Ca, n = 2; M = Sr, n = 3) proved to be catalytically active for the intramolecular hydroamination of 1-amino-2,2-diphenylpent-4-ene to form 2-methyl-4,4-diphenylpyrrolidine, with the calcium species demonstrating a higher turnover number than the strontium analogue (2a, TOF = 500 h\u22121; 2b, TOF = 75 h\u22121). In these instances, because of ambiguities in the structural charcterization of the precatalyst in solution, such quantification holds little value and detailed catalytic studies have not been conducted.",

    "abstract": " In a study relevant to group 2-mediated hydroamination catalysis, the reaction of the \u03b2-diketiminato magnesium alkyl complex [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Mg(n/sBu)] (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) with benzylamine, 2-methoxyethylamine, pyrrolidine, and 2-methyl-4,4-diphenylpyrrolidine has been shown to yield the corresponding magnesium amide complexes [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Mg(NR1R2)] (R1 = H, R2 = CH2Ph, CH2CH2OMe; R1 = R2 = -(CH2)4-, -CH(Me)CH2CPh2CH2-) within the first point of analysis (30 min) at room temperature in near quantitative yield as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Reactions proceeded non-reversibly, and the products have been characterized in both solution and the solid state. While single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the magnesium amides are dimeric in the solid state, with aggregation occurring via \u03bc2-coordinated amide ligands, NMR studies suggest that for more sterically crowded amide ligands discreet monomeric species exist in solution. In contrast, the calcium complex [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)] reacted reversibly with benzylamine at room temperature to form an equilibrium mixture of a calcium benzylamide and bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. A series of Pulsed-Gradient Spin\u2212Echo NMR studies upon \u03b2-diketiminato calcium amides were consistent with the formation of a dimer in solution. A van\u2019t Hoff analysis performed on this mixture allowed \u0394H\u00b0 = \u221251.3 kJ mol\u22121 and \u0394S\u00b0 = \u2212134 J mol\u22121 of the protonolysis/dimerization reaction to be derived and the Gibbs\u2019 free energy to be calculated as \u0394G\u00b0 (298 K) = \u221211.4 kJ mol\u22121.",

Although in all instances solid and solution state data were consistent with the reaction products existing as dimeric species with aggregation occurring via three-center\u2212two-electron bridging acetylide units, a further reaction of 1 with HC\u2261CSi(iPr)3 demonstrated that both monomeric solvated [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{C\u2261CSi(iPr)3}(THF)2] (3b) or dimeric acetylide [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Ca{C\u2261CSi(iPr)3}]2 (3a) species could be isolated from the reaction depending upon the exact conditions of the crystallization of the reaction product from solution. Further solution studies demonstrated the presence of a monomer\u2212dimer equilibrium in solution. A van\u2019t Hoff analysis allowed \u0394G\u00b0(298 K) for the dimerization reaction to be calculated as +27.0 kJ mol\u22121. The reaction of these hydrocarbon-soluble kinetically stabilized calcium acetylides with 1,3-dialkylcarbodiimides gave the corresponding heteroleptic calcium C-propargyl amidinate complexes [{ArNC(Me)CHCN(Me)Ar}Ca{(R2N)2CC\u2261CR1}(THF)n] (R1 = 4-MeC6H4, n = 0, 4a; 4-MeC6H4, n = 1, 4a\u00b7THF; R2 = iPr; R1 = Si(iPr3), R2 = Cy, n = 1, 4b\u00b7THF) via insertion of the carbodiimide into the calcium\u2212carbon \u03c3-bond. The latter complexes have been characterized in both solution and the solid state including single-crystal X-ray analysis of 4a\u00b7THF. Extension of this reactivity to catalytic systems has allowed the application of amide 1 (5 mol %) to the catalytic hydroacetylenation of 1,3-di-isopropylcarbodiimide with phenylacetylene, yielding the corresponding propargyl amidine in 59% yield following crystallization from hexane solution.",

The validity of this analysis was supplemented by a preliminary study of the use of group 2 amides for the intermolecular hydroamination of vinyl arenes. Although strontium was found to provide the highest catalytic activity, in line with the expectation provided by the theoretical study, a preliminary kinetic analysis demonstrated that this is possibly a consequence of the increased radius and accessibility of this cation rather than a reflection of a reduced barrier for rate-determining alkene insertion.",

Simulated data is found to fit well with experimental results using literature values of diffusion coefficients for Fe(CN)64- and Fe(CN)63-. The theoretical models are used to compare responses from interdigitated band and ring arrays, and the size of ring array required to approximate the response to a linear band array is investigated. An equation is developed for the radius of ring required for a pair of electrodes in a ring array to give a result with 5% of a pair of electrodes in a band array. This equation is found to be independent of the scan rate used over six orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA computational model for the simulation of a double band collector\u2013generator experiment is applied to the situation where two electrochemical reactions occur concurrently. It is shown that chronoamperometric measurements can be used to take advantage of differences in diffusion coefficients to measure the concentrations of both electroactive species simultaneously, by measuring the time at which the collection efficiency reaches a specific value. The separation of the electrodes is shown to not affect the sensitivity of the method (in terms of percentage changes in the measured time to reach the specified collection efficiency), but wider gaps can provide a greater range of (larger) absolute values of this characteristic time. It is also shown that measuring the time taken to reach smaller collection efficiencies can allow for the detection of smaller amounts of whichever species diffuses faster. The case of a system containing both ascorbic acid and dopamine in water is used to exemplify the method, and it is shown that mole fractions of ascorbic acid between 0.055 and 0.96 can, in principle, be accurately measured.",

    "abstract": "We have applied density functional theory and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to investigate the relationship between chemically induced strain and charge transfer on the structural, electronic, vibrational, and thermoelectric properties of misfit layered cobaltites (M2CoO3)0.6CoO2 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). The electron and phonon density of states are analyzed and rationalized by accounting for the effects of internal strain and charge transfer, and lay the foundations to disentangle these effects on a promising thermoelectric oxide material. We found that the choice of different interlayer cations has little effect on the magnetic properties, but it generates internal strain between the rock-salt M2CoO3 and hexagonal CoO2 subsystems, changing the hybridization of the cations with the environment. Increasing the mass of the cation leads to decoupling of the vibrations between the rock-salt and CoO2 subsystems so that heavier cations are predicted to enhance phonon scattering. On the other hand, applying compressive strain to the system, which corresponds to doping with smaller interlayer cations, is shown to enhance the Seebeck coefficient. The calculations suggest that thermoelectric efficiency of misfit layered cobaltites may be tuned by codoping the rock-salt layer with isovalent alkali earth cations.",

Treatment of 2 with the appropriate amine, in the absence of a solvent or catalyst, resulted in the isolation in high yields of [2-(RNCH)C6H4]2SnCl2 [R = 2\u2032-C10H7 (3), 2\u2032,4\u2032,6\u2032-Me3C6H2 (4), PhCH2 (5), Me2NCH2CH2 (6), 2\u2032-PyCH2 (7)]. The reaction of 7 with [Pd(COD)Cl2] provided the heterometallic species [Cl2Pd{2-(2\u2032-PyCH2NCH)C6H4}2SnCl2] (8). The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution, and mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy in the solid state. The molecular structures of 1, 2, 4\u20137 and 8\u00b7CH3CN were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. For all diorganotin(IV) dichlorides intramolecular O\u2192Sn or Nimine\u2192Sn coordination results in hypercoordinated species with a distorted octahedral (C,E)2SnCl2 core (E = O, N). The presence of intramolecular N\u2192Sn interactions in solution, responsible for the restriction of free rotation of mesityl groups around the C\u2013N(C) single bonds, is suggested by 1H and 13C NMR data. In the heterometallic dinuclear complex 8 the octahedral coordination around tin is preserved as in 7 and the nitrogen atoms from the pyridyl groups in the pendant arms are coordinated to palladium, leading to a trans-square planar PdCl2N2 core.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

This paper also undertakes a comparison of the efficiency of processes utilised during wastewater treatment and it discusses under-researched aspects of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in the environment including sorption to solids and stereoselectivity in the fate of chiral drugs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters.The removal efficiency of analytes strongly depended on the type of wastewater treatment technology employed and denoted <\u00a050% or >\u00a060% in the case of tricking filter and activated sludge respectively. It should be stressed, however, that the removal rate was highly variable for different groups of compounds. A clear increase in the cumulative concentration of all monitored compounds was observed in receiving waters; thus highlighting the impact of WWTP discharge on water quality and the importance of the removal efficiency of WWTPs. No seasonal variation was observed with regard to the total load of targeted compounds in the river each month. The concentration of each analyte was largely dependent on rainfall and the dilution factor of WWTP discharge. These results indicate that although the drugs of abuse are not present at very high concentrations in river water (typically low ng\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 levels), their occurrence and possible synergic action is of concern, and the study of multiple groups of drugs of abuse is of significant importance.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe main aim of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive and critical verification of methodology commonly used for sample collection, storage and preparation in studies concerning the analysis of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in aqueous environmental samples with the usage of SPE-LC/MS techniques. This manuscript reports the results of investigations into several sample preparation parameters that to the authors\u2019 knowledge have not been reported or have received very little attention. This includes: (i) effect of evaporation temperature and (ii) solvent with regards to solid phase extraction (SPE) extracts; (iii) effect of silanising glassware; (iv) recovery of analytes during vacuum filtration through glass fibre filters and (v) pre LC\u2013MS filter membranes. All of these parameters are vital to develop efficient and reliable extraction techniques; an essential factor given that target drug residues are often present in the aqueous environment at ng\u00a0L\u22121 levels. Presented is also the first comprehensive review of the stability of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Among the parameters studied are: time of storage, temperature and pH. Over 60 analytes were targeted including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors, human urine indicators and their metabolites. The lack of stability of analytes in raw wastewater was found to be significant for many compounds. For instance, 34% of compounds studied reported a stability change >15% after only 12\u00a0h in raw wastewater stored at 2\u00a0\u00b0C; a very important finding given that wastewater is typically collected with the use of 24\u00a0h composite samplers. The stability of these compounds is also critical given the recent development of so-called \u2018sewage forensics\u2019 or \u2018sewage epidemiology\u2019 in which concentrations of target drug residues in wastewater are used to back-calculate drug consumption. Without an understanding of stability, under (or over) reporting of consumption estimations may take place.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents, for the first time, community-wide estimation of drug and pharmaceuticals consumption in England using wastewater analysis and a large number of compounds. Among groups of compounds studied were: stimulants, hallucinogens and their metabolites, opioids, morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and others. Obtained results showed the usefulness of wastewater analysis in order to provide estimates of local community drug consumption. It is noticeable that where target compounds could be compared to NHS prescription statistics, good comparisons were apparent between the two sets of data. These compounds include oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, methadone, tramadol, temazepam and diazepam. Whereas, discrepancies were observed for propoxyphene, codeine, dosulepin and venlafaxine (over-estimations in each case except codeine). Potential reasons for discrepancies include: sales of drugs sold without prescription and not included within NHS data, abuse of a drug with the compound trafficked through illegal sources, different consumption patterns in different areas, direct disposal leading to over estimations when using parent compound as the drug target residue and excretion factors not being representative of the local community. It is noticeable that using a metabolite (and not a parent drug) as a biomarker leads to higher certainty of obtained estimates. With regard to illicit drugs, consistent and logical results were reported. Monitoring of these compounds over a one week period highlighted the expected recreational use of many of these drugs (e.g. cocaine and MDMA) and the more consistent use of others (e.g. methadone).",

    "abstract": "AbstractA new-multi residue method was developed for the environmental monitoring of 65 stimulants, opiod and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors, human urine indicators and their metabolites in wastewater and surface water. The proposed analytical methodology offers rapid analysis for a large number of compounds, with low limits of quantification and utilises only one solid-phase extraction\u2013ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (SPE\u2013LC\u2013MS/MS) method, thus overcoming the drawbacks of previously published procedures. The method employed solid phase extraction with the usage of Oasis MCX sorbent and subsequent ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013positive electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. The usage of a 1.7\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm particle size column (1\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0150\u00a0mm) resulted in very low flow rates (0.04\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121), and as a consequence gave good sensitivity, low mobile phase consumption and short retention times for all compounds (from 2.9 to 23.1\u00a0min). High SPE recoveries (>60%) were obtained for the majority of compounds. The mean correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were typically higher than 0.997 and showed good linearity in the range 0\u20131000\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcg\u00a0L\u22121. The method limits of detection ranged from 0.1\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for compounds including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, norbenzoylecgonine and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD to 100\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for caffeine. Method quantification limits ranged from 0.5 to 154.2\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121. Intra- and inter-day repeatabilities were on average less than 10%. The method accuracy range was within \u221233.1 to 30.1%. The new multi-residue method was used to analyse drugs of abuse in wastewater and river water in the UK environment. Of the targeted 65 compounds, 46 analytes were detected at levels above the method quantification limit (MQL) in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent, 43 in WWTP effluent and 36 compounds in river water.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of a mobile and polarized organic moiety as a cation in 3D lead-iodide perovskites brings fascinating optoelectronic properties to these materials. The extent and the time scales of the orientational mobility of the organic cation and the molecular mechanism behind its motion remain unclear, with different experimental and computational approaches providing very different qualitative and quantitative description of the molecular dynamics. Here we use ultrafast 2D vibrational spectroscopy of methylammonium (MA) lead iodide to directly resolve the rotation of the organic cations within the MAPbI3 lattice. Our results reveal two characteristic time constants of motion. Using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we identify these as a fast (\u223c300 fs) \u201cwobbling-in-a-cone\u201d motion around the crystal axis and a relatively slow (\u223c3 ps) jump-like reorientation of the molecular dipole with respect to the iodide lattice. The observed dynamics are essential for understanding the electronic properties of perovskite materials.Keywords:  methylammonium lead iodide; molecular dynamics; ultrafast spectroscopy; vibrational spectroscopy; transient anisotropy",

    "abstract": "The dissociation of photogenerated excitons and the subsequent spatial separation of the charges are of crucial importance to the design of efficient donor-acceptor heterojunction solar cells. While huge progress has been made in understanding charge generation at all-organic junctions, the process in hybrid organic:inorganic systems has barely been addressed. Here, we explore the influence of energetic driving force and local crystallinity on the efficiency of charge pair generation at hybrid organic:inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions. We use x-ray diffraction, photoluminescence quenching, transient absorption spectroscopy, photovoltaic device and electroluminescence measurements to demonstrate that the dissociation of photogenerated polaron pairs at hybrid heterojunctions is assisted by the presence of crystalline electron acceptor domains. We propose that such domains encourage delocalization of the geminate pair state. The present findings suggest that the requirement for a large driving energy for charge separation is relaxed when a more crystalline electron acceptor is used.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents and compares for the first time two chiral LC\u2013QTOF-MS methodologies (utilising CBH and Chirobiotic V columns with cellobiohydrolase and vancomycin as chiral selectors) for the quantification of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA (methylenedioxyamphetamine), MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol, fluoxetine and venlafaxine in river water and sewage effluent. The lowest MDLs (0.3\u20135.0\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 and 1.3\u201315.1\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 for river water and sewage effluent respectively) were observed using the chiral column Chirobiotic V. This is with the exception of methamphetamine and MDMA which had lower MDLs using the CBH column. However, the CBH column resulted in better resolution of enantiomers (Rs\u00a0=\u00a02.5 for amphetamine compared with Rs\u00a0=\u00a01.2 with Chirobiotic V). Method recovery rates were typically >80% for both methodologies. Pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs detected and quantified in environmental samples were successfully identified using MS/MS confirmation. In sewage effluent, the total beta-blocker concentrations of propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol were on average 77.0, 1091.0 and 3.6\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121 thus having EFs (Enantiomeric Fractions) of 0.43, 0.55 and 0.54 respectively. In river water, total propranolol and atenolol was quantified on average at <10.0\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u22121. Differences in EF between sewage and river water matrices were evident: venlafaxine was observed with respective EF of 0.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPresented is the first comprehensive study of drugs of abuse on suspended particulate matter (SPM) in wastewater. Analysis of SPM is crucial to prevent the under-reporting of the levels of analyte that may be present in wastewater. Analytical methods to date analyse the aqueous part of wastewater samples only, removing SPM through the use of filtration or centrifugation. The development of an analytical method to determine 60 compounds on SPM using a combination of pressurised liquid extraction, solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (PLE-SPE-LC\u2013MS/MS) is reported. The range of compounds monitored included stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors, and their metabolites. The method was successfully validated (parameters studied: linearity and range, recovery, accuracy, reproducibility, repeatability, matrix effects, and limits of detection and quantification). The developed methodology was applied to SPM samples collected at three wastewater treatment plants in the UK. The average proportion of analyte on SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase was <5% for several compounds including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, MDMA, and ketamine; whereas the proportion was >10% with regard to methadone, EDDP, EMDP, BZP, fentanyl, nortramadol, norpropoxyphene, sildenafil and all antidepressants (dosulepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine). Consequently, the lack of SPM analysis in wastewater sampling protocol could lead to the under-reporting of the measured concentration of some compounds.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHere presented for the first time is the enantioselective biodegradation of amphetamine and methamphetamine in river microcosm bioreactors. The aim of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that mechanisms governing the fate of amphetamine and methamphetamine in the environment are mostly stereoselective and biological in nature. Several bioreactors were studied over the duration of 15 days (i) in both biotic and abiotic conditions, (ii) in the dark or exposed to light and (iii) in the presence or absence of suspended particulate matter. Bioreactor samples were analysed using SPE-chiral-LC-(QTOF)MS methodology. This investigation has elucidated the fundamental mechanism for degradation of amphetamine and methamphetamine as being predominantly biological in origin. Furthermore, stereoselectivity and changes in enantiomeric fraction (EF) were only observed under biotic conditions. Neither amphetamine nor methamphetamine appeared to demonstrate adsorption to suspended particulate matter. Our experiments also demonstrated that amphetamine and methamphetamine were photo-stable. Illicit drugs are present in the environment at low concentrations but due to their pseudo-persistence and non-racemic behaviour, with two enantiomers revealing significantly different potency (and potentially different toxicity towards aquatic organisms) the risk posed by illicit drugs in the environment should not be under- or over-estimated. The above results demonstrate the need for re-evaluation of the procedures utilised in environmental risk assessment, which currently do not recognise the importance of the phenomenon of chirality in pharmacologically active compounds.",

Solid Fe(BTC) immobilised onto graphite or platinum working electrodes is investigated and it is shown that well-defined and reversible Fe(III/II) reduction responses occur only on platinum and in the presence of aqueous acid. The process is shown to follow a CE-type mechanism involving liberation of Fe(III) in acidic media, in particular for high concentrations of acid. Effective electrocatalysis for the oxidation of hydroxide to O2 (anodic water splitting) is observed in alkaline aqueous media after initial cycling of the potential into the reduction potential zone. A mechanism based on a MOF-surface confined hydrous iron oxide film is proposed.",

The monitoring of SPM is crucial for target analytes because, depending on their physico-chemical properties, they may partition to particulates; thus, analysis of wastewater only will result in under-reporting of the concentration of target analytes in the sample. A daily one week monitoring study was carried out at a WWTP serving one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic; representing the first comprehensive application of the sewage epidemiology approach in the Czech Republic. In total, 60 analytes were targeted in the monitoring programme including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors and their metabolites. Analysis of SPM determined that significant proportions of some compounds were present on the solids. For example, 21.0\u201349.8% of the total concentration of EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) in the sample was determined on SPM and 11.2\u201319.6% of methadone. The highest proportion on SPM was determined for fluoxetine in the range 68.1\u201379.6%, norfluoxetine 46.6\u201361.9% and amitriptyline 21.8\u201351.2%. In contrast, some compounds presented very little partitioning to SPM. Less than 5% was determined partitioned to SPM over the week period for analytes including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol, nortramadol, oxazepam and ephedrine. Determined concentrations in wastewater influent were subsequently utilised in the sewage epidemiology approach to estimate drug consumption, in the community from which the wastewater was derived. This back-calculation was updated for the first time to include the concentration of analytes present on SPM. The consumption of methamphetamine and MDMA was determined to be especially high in the studied community in relation to other European countries, while cocaine and methadone consumption was relatively low. This manuscript shows that in order to apply the sewage epidemiology approach, SPM analysis is required for some compounds; whereas for others the partitioning is small and one may regard this as negligible.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis paper uses the \u2018traditional\u2019 Information Systems (IS) success model literature (e.g. Grover, DeLone and McLean, Seddon, Alter etc.) as the starting point for developing a new model intended to support better outcomes when migrating/porting an IS functionality to a cloud. In simple terms \u2018cloud\u2019 refers to an IS functionality accessed (rented) by users through a thin client (web browser, mobile applications, etc.) while the software, hardware and data are stored on remote servers. Its popularity as an approach reflects claims that such \u2018shared resources\u2019 model (akin to a utility like the electricity grid) will allow organisation to access more advanced and flexible IS services at a lower aggregate cost. This paper argues that cloud migration requires organisations to consider a range of additional success factors, including how to accommodate new delivery modes (e.g. different pricing models) and manage new risks (e.g. data out side organisational firewalls, etc). Despite burgeoning interest in the topic, specific empirical research and, more importantly, specific practitioner guidance remains limited. This paper therefore concludes by presenting a preliminary conceptual model (informed by Systems Thinking) along with steps to operationalise it and suggests empirical options to test this model.",

    "abstract": "Periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) materials offer a strategy to position molecular semiconductors within a highly defined, porous network. We developed thin films of a new semiconducting zinc phthalocyanine-bridged PMO exhibiting a face-centered orthorhombic pore structure with an average pore diameter of 11\u2005nm. The exceptional degree of order achieved with this PMO enabled us to create thin films consisting of a single porous domain throughout their entire thickness, thus providing maximal accessibility for subsequent incorporation of a complementary phase. The phthalocyanine building blocks inside the pore walls were found to be well-aggregated, enabling electronic conductivity and extending the light-harvesting capabilities to the near IR region. Ordered 3D heterojunctions capable of promoting photo-induced charge transfer were constructed by impregnation of the PMO with a fullerene derivative. When integrated into a photovoltaic device, the infiltrated PMO is capable of producing a high open-circuit voltage and a considerable photocurrent, which represents a significant step towards potential applications of PMOs in optoelectronics.",

These new catenanes contain both the donor and acceptor components in at least one of the interlocked rings, thereby possessing unusual and unexpected DAAD or DADD stacking sequences of the \u03c0 units in their structures. The efficiency of the catenane assembly process can be enhanced by manipulating the DCL equilibrium in a variety of ways: adding a guest, changing the building block stoichiometries, or increasing the library concentration or the ionic strength of the solvent. The formation of catenanes and their constitutions are found to be dependent on subtle differences in the geometry, dimension, and flexibility of the donor building blocks.",

Confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging indicate that emission occurs on treating HeLa cells with the complex and co-localisation studies demonstrate that this is from the mitochondria and lipid-rich regions of the cell.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "AbstractUnderstanding diffusion in alumina is a long-standing challenge in ceramic science. The present article applies a novel combination of metadynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approaches to the investigation of oxygen vacancy diffusion in alumina. Three classes of diffusive jumps with different activation energies were identified, the resulting diffusion coefficient being best fitted by an Arrhenius equation having a pre-exponential factor of 7.88\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0m2\u00a0s\u22121 and an activation energy of 510.83\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121. This activation energy is very close to values for the most pure aluminas studied experimentally (activation energy 531\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121). The good agreement indicates that the dominating atomic-scale diffusion mechanism in alumina is vacancy diffusion.",

Our studies, focusing on poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), show that the charge mobility is dominated by pathways with the highest interchain charge-transfer rates. We also find that disorder is not always detrimental to charge transport. We find good agreement with experimental time-of-flight mobility data in highly aligned PFO films.  ",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe evasion of the host immune response is central to the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus, and is facilitated by the ability of the cell wall-associated protein A (SpA) to bind immunoglobulin G Fc fragments, thereby impeding phacocytosis and classical pathway complement fixation. SpA also acts as a B-cell superantigen through interactions with the heavy-chain variable part of Fab fragments, and sequesters immunoglobulins by forming large insoluble immune complexes with human IgG.Here we show that the formation of insoluble immune complexes is mediated by the binding of (VH3+) Fab fragments in addition to Fc, and that SpA forms soluble complexes with IgG Fc fragments. We compared these results with those for Sbi, a second staphylococcal immunoglobulin-binding protein, and note that this protein requires only the Fc fragment for precipitation with human IgG. Homology models of immunoglobulin-binding domains of SpA and Sbi in complex with Fc reveal the molecular basis of the Fab-independent formation of insoluble complexes by Sbi. Finally, we compared the sequences of the spa and sbi genes from human strains to those infecting a range of animal hosts to determine whether Sbi and SpA have acquired specificity for host IgG. We note remarkable sequence conservation within the IgG-binding domains of these genes, consistent with a lack of host specificity.The Fab-independent binding of IgG by Sbi could have significant clinical implications. The use of SpA in immunoadsorption therapy can cause severe side-effects, thought to be mediated by Fc\u00ce\u00b3R recognition and complement fixation. The formation of insoluble immune complexes with Sbi occurs only via Fc binding and free Fc regions are unlikely to be available for Fc\u00ce\u00b3R recognition and complement fixation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMolecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate possible explanations for experimentally observed differences in the growth modification of calcite particles by two organic additives, polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyaspartic acid (p-ASP). The more rigid backbone of p-ASP was found to inhibit the formation of stable complexes with counter-ions in solution, resulting in a higher availability of p-ASP compared to PAA for surface adsorption. Furthermore the presence of nitrogen on the p-ASP backbone yields favorable electrostatic interactions with the surface, resulting in negative adsorption energies, in an upright (brush conformation). This leads to a more rapid binding and longer residence times at calcite surfaces compared to PAA, which adsorbed in a flat (pancake) configuration with positive adsorption energies. The PAA adsorption occurring despite this positive energy difference can be attributed to the disruption of the ordered water layer seen in the simulations and hence a significant entropic contribution to the adsorption free energy. These findings help explain the stronger inhibiting effect on calcite growth observed by p-ASP compared to PAA and can be used as guidelines in the design of additives leading to even more marked growth modifying effects.",

    "abstract": "A stable three-coordinate dimethylberyllium species coordinated by the 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IMes) ligand is readily converted to the corresponding methylhydrido derivative through metathetical reaction with phenylsilane. Attempts to synthesize the corresponding molecular dihydrides are, however, unsuccessful and result in ring opening of an IMes ligand through hydride transfer to the donor carbon atom and the consequent formation of a heterocyclic beryllium organoamide. In agreement with previous calculations, we suggest that this process occurs via a Schlenk-type equilibration process and formation of a four-coordinate bis-NHC beryllium dihydride. These species are not observed, however, as the steric pressure exerted by coordination of the two sterically demanding IMes ligands is sufficient to induce hydride transfer. The latter deduction is supported by the observation that a similar ring-opened product, but derived from methyl and hydride transfer, is available through the introduction of a further equivalent of IMes to the isolated beryllium methyl hydride species. In the latter case the ring-opening process is more facile, which we ascribe to the increased steric pressure achieved upon the formation of four-coordinate beryllium. In a further striking reaction under more forcing thermal conditions, the carbene carbon center of an IMes ligand is observed to be completely eliminated with selective formation of a three-coordinate diamidoberyllium species.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of functionalised imidazolidine-2-ones and -thiones, 2-imino-imidazolidines and thiazolidine-2-thiones have been synthesised under very mild reaction conditions by using simple and cost-effective alkaline earth bis(amide) precatalysts, [Ae{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (Ae=Mg, Ca, Sr). The reactions ensue with 100\u2009% atom efficiency as one-pot cascades from simple, commercially available terminal alkyne and heterocumulene reagents. The reactions take place through the initial assembly of propargylamidines, which are utilised in subsequent cyclisation reactions through addition of the isocyanate, isothiocyanate and, in one case, carbon disulfide reagents. This reactivity is deduced to take place through a well-defined sequence of heterocumulene hydroacetylenation and alkyne hydroamidation steps, which are all mediated at the alkaline earth centre. The rate and regioselectivity of the cyclisation reactions are, thus, found to be heavily dependent upon the identity of the catalytic alkaline earth centre employed. Similarly, the selectivity of the reactions was observed to be profoundly affected by stereoelectronic variations in the individual substrates, albeit by a similar Group\u20052-centred reaction mechanism in all cases studied.",

For this volume, the critical reviews cover topics such as the activation of \"inert\" carbon-hydrogen bonds, ligand design and organometallic radical species. For example, Charlie O'Hara discusses how mixed-metal compounds may perform the highly selective activation of C-H bonds and, in particular, how synergic relationships between various metals are crucial to this approach. The chemistry of a remarkable series of air-stable chiral primary phosphine ligands is discussed in some depth by Rachel Hiney, Arne Ficks, Helge Muller-Bunz, Declan Gilheany and Lee Higham. This article focuses on the preparation of these ligands and also how they may be applied in various catalytic applications.

An assessment of the Mg, Ca, and Sr alkyl compounds as precatalysts for the intramolecular hydroamination of aminoalkenes evidenced enhanced reactivity, which is ascribed to the greater solution stability of the catalytically active species.

In all four cases deprotonation appears to occur by a common pathway involving pyridine dearomatization and subsequent deprotonation of a single imine-bound methyl substituent.

The silylamide complexes [{H2B(ImtBu)2}M{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)n] (M = Ca, n = 1; M = Sr, n = 2), containing N-tert-butyl-substituted imidazolin-2-ylidene fragments, are stable to intermolecular solution redistribution despite some evidence of solution fluxionality in the case of M = Ca. Attempts to synthesize heteroleptic iodide-containing species led to the isolation of the homoleptic compounds [{H2B(ImtBu)2}2MTHF)n] (M = Ca, n = 1; M = Sr, n = 2) most likely because of the reduced steric demands of the halide coligand. Although extension of the \u201cone pot\u201d synthetic method to precursors containing N-mesityl-substituted imidazoles resulted in extensive ligand degradation, use of [Ca{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] as both base and group 2 element source provided the target heteroleptic silylamide complex. X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated that the borate ligands adopt a facial \u03b73-binding mode in which coordination is provided through the two N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors and an additional agostic-type interacton from one hydrogen of the BH2 residue. Analysis of this ligand binding by DFT methods indicates that, although the bonds from the carbon centers are similar in character to those provided by neutral NHC ligands, the bonding is supplemented by an electrostatic component which is manifested as a coordination of a hydridic BH bond. The ionic nature of the overall interaction is sufficient to maintain the metal\u2212ligand binding in the presence of amine donors and has allowed the evaluation of the Ca and Sr complexes [{H2B(ImtBu)2}M{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)n] as precatalysts for the intramolecular hydroamination of aminoalkenes. While the calcium catalyst provides activities commensurate with our previously reported \u03b2-diketiminato complex, [CH{C(Me)N(2,6-iPr2C6H3)}Ca{N(SiMe3)2}(THF)], the strontium derivative is superior in all cases.",

Catalysis is proposed to occur through a sequence of MgN/BH metathesis and rate-determining MgH/NC insertion steps, a proposal strongly supported by stoichiometric studies and kinetic analysis. The reactions are observed to proceed through the intermediacy of well-defined magnesium amides, two examples of which have been isolated and structurally characterized. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the catalytic rate-determining process occurs at an isolated magnesium center and requires the presence of two molecules of the imine substrate for effective turnover.

    "abstract": "The magnesium methyl and the calcium and strontium silylamide \u03b2-diketiminate derivatives [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}MX(THF)n] (M = Mg, X = CH3, n = 0; M = Ca, X = N(SiMe3)2, n = 0 or 1; M = Sr, X = N(SiMe3)2, n = 1, Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl), the silylamides [M{N(SiMe3)2}2]2 and [M{N(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba), and the alkyl species [M{CH(SiMe3)2}2(THF)2] (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) have been studied as precatalysts for the hydroamination/cyclization of aminoalkenes. Hydroamination afforded a series of five- and six-membered pyrrolidine and piperidine derivatives in near quantitative yields with all precatalysts, apart from the barium species, which were apparently limited to a maximum of two turnovers with even the favorable 1-amino-2,2-diphenyl-4-pentene substrate. Significant formation of hexahydroazepines was observed only with the magnesium amide species, while the group 2 dialkyl derivatives decomposed at high reaction temperatures and proved to be more limited in scope. In general, the calcium precatalysts proved to be more reactive than their strontium analogues, which, in turn, proved to be far more reactive than the magnesium species. Among the \u03b2-diketiminate derivatives, the greater coordinative unsaturation of the THF-free calcium derivative provided increased activity for the cyclization of primary aminoalkene substrates in comparison to its THF-solvated counterpart. In contrast, the unsolvated bis(amides) displayed lower activity with these substrates than their THF-solvated analogues. Use of silylamide precatalysts provides potentially reversible entry into the catalytic manifold. The position of the equilibrium is perturbed by both the nature of the substrate and the identity of the group 2 element, highlighted by the reaction of [{ArNC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr}Sr{N(SiMe3)2(THF)] with 2-methoxyethylamine, which results in equilibration between the starting silylamide, an isolable amine adduct, and the product of amine/silylamide transamination. Performing the same reaction with the calcium precatalyst provided the analogue of the latter product as the only observable species. A kinetic study of the cyclization of (1-allylcyclohexyl)methanamine with each of the calcium and strontium silylamide precatalysts provided an apparent first-order dependence in [catalyst], while determination of the activation barriers and Eyring analyses provided quantitative evidence that the group 2 catalysts reported herein provide activities at least commensurate with previously reported lanthanide-based catalyses. In the particular cases of systems based upon calcium and strontium, an enhanced catalytic performance is proposed to arise from a tangible entropic advantage resulting from the reduced charge density of the larger divalent alkaline earth cations and consequentially less constrained rate-determining alkene insertion transition states. The rate of cyclization was also found to decrease with increasing substrate concentration. This latter observation, along with the observation of large kinetic isotope effects (>4), proposed to be a result of a beneficial and concerted proton transfer step associated with rate-determining alkene insertion, are reasoned to be consistent with Michaelis\u2212Menten-type kinetics.",

We are particularly interested in showing the effects of the structural properties on the intercalation energies and on the energy barriers for ion diffusion. The most favourable directions for Li+ transport are highlighted and we observe an anisotropic diffusion in rutile, brookite and TiO2-B whereas the diffusion is isotropic in the case of anatase. The lowest energy barrier is calculated in rutile but it is not a key factor to determine the efficiency of Li-battery materials. Intercalation energies of stable and transition states are however important data to take into account as well as the Li pathway in order to evaluate the potentiality of each polymorph for Li migration.",

Structures exhibiting inter-layer spaces and channels frequently have these lined by terminal fluoride anions of the PO3F, PO2(OH,F)2 and Mn(O,F)6 octahedra.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "Hydrofluorothermal methods are shown to offer a facile route to a very large family of mid-late first row, transition metal fluorophosphates with 50 new compounds identified to date for manganese(III), iron(III), cobalt(II), and copper(II). Reactions of a transition metal fluoride with a phosphate source in a very low-water, high-fluoride content system and in the presence of framework charge balancing metal cations or template molecular cations, lead to materials with structures formed from linked M(O,F)n and P(O,F)n polyhedra. The structures of these materials, which contain a variety of 1, 2, and 3-dimensional motifs with a level of framework termination dependent upon their fluoride content, show numerous useful characteristics for functionality and applications. The new and unusual features of these fluorophosphate materials include interlayer spaces or channels lined with fluoride ions, metal polyhedra, M(O,F)n, linked through vertex, edge, or face-sharing, and \u03bc2, \u03bc3, and \u03bc4 bridging fluoride ions. Preliminary characterization of the properties of some of these metal fluorophosphates is reported, including reductive lithium ion insertion, of interest for Li-ion battery positive electrodes, ion exchange reactions, the formation of nanoporous material derivatives through template destruction, and magnetic susceptibility behaviors.",

Halide complexes of the form [LBeX] (X = Cl, I) and a bis(trimethylsilyl)amide complex were produced via salt metathesis routes. Alkylberyllium \u03b2-diketiminate complexes of the form [LBeR] (R = Me, nBu) were obtained by salt metathesis from the chloride precursor [LBeCl]. Controlled hydrolysis of [LBeMe] afforded an air-stable, monomeric \u03b2-diketiminatoberyllium hydroxide complex. [LBeMe] also underwent facile protonolysis with alcohols to form the corresponding \u03b2-diketiminatoberyllium alkoxides [LBeOR] (R = Me, tBu, Ph). High temperatures and prolonged reaction times were required for protonolysis of [LBeMe] with primary amines to yield the \u03b2-diketiminatoberyllium amide complexes [LBeNHR] (R = nBu, CH2Ph, Ph). No reactions were observed between [LBeMe] and silanes, terminal acetylenes, or secondary amines. All compounds were characterized by 1H, 13C, and 9Be NMR spectroscopy and, in most cases, by X-ray crystallography. Reduction of the beryllium chloride complex with potassium metal resulted in apparent hydrogen-atom transfer between two \u03b2-diketiminate backbones, yielding two dimeric, potassium chloride bridged diamidoberyllium species. X-ray analysis of a cocrystallized mixture of the 18-crown-6 adducts of these species allowed unambiguous identification of the two reduced diketiminate ligands, one of which had been deprotonated at a backbone methyl substituent and the other reduced by hydride addition to the \u03b2-imine position. It is proposed that this process occurs by the formation of an unobserved radical anion species and intermolecular hydrogen-atom transfer by a radical-based hydrogen abstraction mechanism.",

Molecular structure analysis by X-ray crystallography establishes that the cation\u2013anion interaction varies as a function of the alkali-metal, with the carbanion binding to lithium mainly in a \u03c3 fashion, to potassium mainly in a \u03c0 fashion, with the interaction toward sodium being intermediate between these two extremes. This distinction is due to the heavier alkali-metal forcing and using the delocalization of negative charge into the aromatic ring to gain a higher coordination number in accordance with its size. Me6TREN binds the metal in a \u03b74 mode at all times. This coordination isomerism is shown by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to also extend to the structures in solution and is further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on model systems. A Me6TREN stabilized benzyl potassium complex has been used to prepare a mixed-metal ate complex by a cocomplexation reaction with tBu2Zn, with the benzyl ligand acting as an unusual ditopic \u03c3/\u03c0 bridging ligand between the two metals, and with the small zinc atom relocalizing the negative charge back on to the lateral CH2 arm to give a complex best described as a contacted ion pair potassium zincate.",

    "abstract": "The importance of exploring new low-cost and safe cathodes for large-scale lithium batteries has led to increasing interest in Li2FeSiO4. The structure of Li2FeSiO4 undergoes significant change on cycling, from the as-prepared \u03b3s form to an inverse \u03b2II polymorph; therefore it is important to establish the structure of the cycled material. In \u03b3s half the LiO4, FeO4, and SiO4 tetrahedra point in opposite directions in an ordered manner and exhibit extensive edge sharing. Transformation to the inverse \u03b2II polymorph on cycling involves inversion of half the SiO4, FeO4, and LiO4 tetrahedra, such that they all now point in the same direction, eliminating edge sharing between cation sites and flattening the oxygen layers. As a result of the structural changes, Li+ transport paths and corresponding Li\u2013Li separations in the cycled structure are quite different from the as-prepared material, as revealed here by computer modeling, and involve distinct zigzag paths between both Li sites and through intervening unoccupied octahedral sites that share faces with the LiO4 tetrahedra.",

    "abstract": "Lithium can be reversibly intercalated into layered Li1+xV1\u2212xO2 (LiCoO2 structure) at \u223c0.1\u2009V, but only if x>0. The low voltage combined with a higher density than graphite results in a higher theoretical volumetric energy density; important for future applications in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Here we investigate the crucial question, why Li cannot intercalate into LiVO2 but Li-rich compositions switch on intercalation at an unprecedented low voltage for an oxide? We show that Li+ intercalated into tetrahedral sites are energetically more stable for Li-rich compositions, as they share a face with Li+ on the V site in the transition metal layers. Li incorporation triggers shearing of the oxide layers from cubic to hexagonal packing because the Li2VO2 structure can accommodate two Li per formula unit in tetrahedral sites without face sharing. Such understanding is important for the future design and optimization of low-voltage intercalation anodes for lithium batteries.",

This has enabled us to confirm that a 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate aldolase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus demonstrates good activity for catalysis of the retro-aldol cleavage of both these enantiomers to afford pyruvate and glycolaldehyde. The stereochemical promiscuity of this aldolase towards these enantiomeric aldol substrates confirms that this organism employs a metabolically promiscuous pathway to catabolise the C5-sugars D-xylose and L-arabinose.",

    "abstract": "Diverse ab initio and density-functional-theory methods were used to investigate geometries, energies, and electronic absorption spectra of guanidine and its protonated form, as well as their photo-deactivation processes. It was shown that the guanidine is a weakly absorbing species with the excitation spectrum consisting mostly of transitions to the Rydberg excited states and one valence n-\u03c04 state. The lowest energy band has a maximum at ca. 6.9 eV (\u223c180 nm). The protonation of guanidine affects its excitation spectrum substantially. A major shift of the Rydberg states to higher energies is clearly visible and strongly absorbing transitions from the ground state to the \u03c03-\u03c04 and \u03c02-\u03c04 states appears at 7.8 eV (\u223c160 nm). Three low-lying conical intersections (two for guanidine and one for protonated guanidine) between the ground state and the first excited singlet state were located. They are accessible from the Franck\u2013Condon region through amino N\u2013H stretching and out-of-plane deformations in guanidine and protonated guanidine, respectively. The relaxation of the \u03c03-3s Rydberg state via amino N\u2013H bond stretching was hindered by a barrier. The nondissociated conical intersection in protonated guanidine mediates the radiationless deactivation of the compound after excitation into the \u03c03-\u03c04 state. This fact is detrimental for the photostability of guanidine, since its conjugate acid is stable in aqueous solution over a wide pH range and in protein environment, where guanidinium moiety in arginine is expected to be in a protonated form.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNitrosoamines, mainly N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), are highly mutagenic compounds that are suspected of carcinogenic activity in the human body. The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classified these compounds into the B2 group, which indicates probable carcinogenicity to humans. According to the US EPA, the maximum admissible concentration of these compounds in drinking water is 7 ng L\u22121 (NDMA) and 2 ng L\u22121 (NDEA) with the risk estimation of 10\u22125. Until now, knowledge of the formation of nitrosoamines has been based on the mechanism of a secondary alkylamine reaction with nitrite. The problem becomes critical when the concentration of NDMA reaches 10 ng L\u22121 in surface waters and 20 ng L\u22121 in drinking water production wells that are under the influence of recharge water from wastewater treatment plants. Furthermore, waters coming from purified sewage were contaminated with 100 ng L\u22121 of NDMA. It was reported in 2001 that NDMA is formed during the disinfection of water and sewage with chlorine. The results indicated that the reaction of chlorination of water containing dimethylamine with chlorine leads to the formation of NDMA as one of many by-products. NDMA comprises less than 5% of these products. The concentration of NDMA was closely related to the ratio of chlorine, ammonia ions and dimethylamine. Furthermore, the concentration of nitrosoamine increased with the concentration of monochloramine as well as the reaction time. It should be emphasized that the maximum concentration of NDMA is formed at pH 7\u20138. Therefore, NDMA can be treated as a new disinfection by-product such as THMs, HAAs or MX. Experimental results indicated that the usage of both chlorine and chlorine dioxide leads to the formation of NDMA. In model experiments, in the aqueous solutions containing dimethylamine and ammonia ions disinfected with chlorine dioxide, a few hundred micrograms of N-dimethylnitrosoamine were found. Contrary to the reactions of dimethylamine with chlorine and chlorine dioxide, reactions with ozone do not lead to the formation of NDMA.",

Contact time, ozone/DMA ratio and radical scavengers are other variables controlling the yield of reaction. Data from the literature and observed ozonation by-products suggest that nitrosation of DMA might be responsible for nitrosamine generation. NDMA can be recognized as a by-product of ozonation of DMA in water, which is formed in a specific, but reasonable, range of ozone/DMA ratios.The reaction may have potential importance for water treatment technology assuming reasonable micrograms per liter of DMA concentrations in raw waters.",

This novel application of IGC derived surface characterisation of solids further extends the usefulness of the method in this type of work.",

All the structures incorporate an aza-enolate (1-aza-allyl) anion (=R) derived from deprotonation of the lactim ether at the \u03b1-C, and its subsequent electronic rearrangement such that the metal bonds to the amido N. Lithiation resulted in crystals of [R3{R(Me2SiO)}Li4\u00b7(thf)4], 1, with Me2SiO\u2212 incorporated from the base induced decomposition of silicone grease; the linked dimer [R4Li4\u00b7(tmeda)3], 2, which has both terminal and bridging tmeda molecules; the octanuclear cluster [R6\u2013\u03bc6-O\u2013Li8\u00b7(pyr)2], 3, which is constructed around an O2\u2212 anion; and [R(CH2CHO)2Li3\u00b7pmdta]2, 4, which incorporates lithium ethenolate, the base induced decomposition product of thf.

Solution NMR studies on the reaction between RH and tBuLi in the absence of a Lewis donor revealed that both the rate of deprotonation at the \u03b1-carbon and nucleophilic substitution of the ether functionality decrease substantially.

    "abstract": "TRPA1 is a unique sensor of noxious stimuli and, hence, a potential drug target for analgesics. Here we show that the antinociceptive effects of spinal and systemic administration of acetaminophen (paracetamol) are lost in Trpa1\u2212/\u2212 mice. The electrophilic metabolites N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine and p-benzoquinone, but not acetaminophen itself, activate mouse and human TRPA1. These metabolites also activate native TRPA1 and, as a consequence, reduce voltage-gated calcium and sodium currents in primary sensory neurons. The N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine metabolite L-cysteinyl-S-acetaminophen was detected in the mouse spinal cord after systemic acetaminophen administration. In the hot-plate test, intrathecal administration of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, p-benzoquinone and the electrophilic TRPA1 activator cinnamaldehyde produced antinociception that was lost in Trpa1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Intrathecal injection of a non-electrophilic cannabinoid, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabiorcol, also produced TRPA1-dependent antinociception in this test. Our study provides a molecular mechanism for the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen and discloses spinal TRPA1 activation as a potential pharmacological strategy to alleviate pain.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA voltammetric study of dihydroxybenzene isomers has been carried out at the surface of a glassy carbon electrode modified with a carbon nanoparticle\u2013chitosan high surface area composite film. Generally, the adsorption of analytes into the nanocomposite film is possible based on cation (chitosan), anion (surface-sulfonates of Emperor 2000\u2122 particles), and neutral sites (graphitic carbon). Although all three types of adsorption are observed in aqueous media, the dominant effect is shown here to be weak adsorption of neutral molecules such as dihydroxybenzenes, which are bound and detected with good sensitivity and selectivity.Potential sweep rate and pH effects on the response of the electrode for the oxidation of dihydroxybenzens are investigated. At pH 7 separate oxidation peak potentials were observed at 0.10, 0.19, and 0.58\u00a0V versus SCE for hydroquinone, catechol, and resorcinol, respectively. Dynamic linear ranges obtained in differential pulse voltammetry analysis were 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, and 8.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u20131.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u22121.

    "abstract": "Cellulose is the most familiar and most abundant strong biopolymer, but the reasons for its outstanding mechanical performance are not well understood. Each glucose unit in a cellulose chain is joined to the next by a covalent C\u2013O\u2013C linkage flanked by two hydrogen bonds. This geometry suggests some form of cooperativity between covalent and hydrogen bonding. Using infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, we show that mechanical tension straightens out the zigzag conformation of the cellulose chain, with each glucose unit pivoting around a fulcrum at either end. Straightening the chain leads to a small increase in its length and is resisted by one of the flanking hydrogen bonds. This constitutes a simple form of molecular leverage with the covalent structure providing the fulcrum and gives the hydrogen bond an unexpectedly amplified effect on the tensile stiffness of the chain. The principle of molecular leverage can be directly applied to certain other carbohydrate polymers, including the animal polysaccharide chitin. Related but more complex effects are possible in some proteins and nucleic acids. The stiffening of cellulose by this mechanism is, however, in complete contrast to the way in which hydrogen bonding provides toughness combined with extensibility in protein materials like spider silk.",

Results showed that, fluorescence records of DNSBA increase in a dose dependent manner upon increasing the bacterial cell numbers. Moreover, the increase in the number of bacterial cells induces a shift in the spectra due to the formation of the anionic form of boronic acid complex. Therefore, DNSBA is an efficient sensor for monitoring bacterial cells.",

In order to investigate the influence of the other hydrogen bond donors and acceptors present on these structures, the bis(thiosemicarbazide)nickel(II) complexes trans-[NiL2]2+, where L is the methyl substituted thiosemicarbazides L2 [NHMeC(S)NHNH2], L3 [NHMeC(S)NHNMe2] and L4 [NH2C(S)NHNMe2], have been prepared as terephthalate (tere) salts and their crystal structures investigated. The supramolecular structures of trans-[Ni(L2)2][tere]\u00b74H2O 2 and trans-[Ni(L3)2(OH2)2][tere] 3 show the expected R22(8) motif linking the cations and anions into chains which are, in turn, cross-linked into sheets via amino N\u2013H\u00b7\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u00b7O hydrogen bonds in 2 and aqua O\u2013H\u00b7\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u00b7O hydrogen bonds in 3.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that forms highly stable communities \u2013 biofilms, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of infections. The biofilm state and intrinsic/acquired bacterial resistance mechanisms contribute to resistance/tolerance to antibiotics that is frequently observed in P.\u2009aeruginosa isolates. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of six novel lytic bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria, which together efficiently infect and kill a wide range of P.\u2009aeruginosa clinical isolates. The phages were used to formulate a cocktail with the potential to eliminate P.\u2009aeruginosa\u2005PAO1 planktonic cultures. Two biofilm models were studied, one static and one dynamic, and the phage cocktail was assessed for its ability to reduce and disperse the biofilm biomass. For the static model, after 4\u2009h of contact with the phage suspension (MOI 10) more than 95% of biofilm biomass was eliminated. In the flow biofilm model, a slower rate of activity by the phage was observed, but 48\u2009h after addition of the phage cocktail the biofilm was dispersed, with most cells eliminated (>\u20094\u2009logs) comparing with the control. This cocktail has the potential for development as a therapeutic to control P.\u2009aeruginosa infections, which are predominantly biofilm centred.",

    "abstract": "The tris(aminoethyl)amine derivative tris{[(para-nitrobenzyl)phenyl]aminoethyl}amine [(p-NO2BP)3tren] was reacted with copper(II) nitrate in thf to yield three different solvates of [Cu(p-NO2BP)3trenNO3]NO3 (C1) in the solid state, namely \u03b1-C1\u00b72thf (C2), \u03b2-C1\u00b72.5thf (C3) and \u03b1-C1\u00b7(thf)1.5\u00b7(iPr2O)0.25 (C4). The light green-yellow coloured complexes, C2 and C4, are different solvates of the one distortion isomer, while the dark-green C3 is a different distortion isomer. The spectral properties of these distortion isomers were examined, and the structures of C3 and C4 were determined by X-ray crystallography. The difference in the physical properties (EPR and reflectance electronic spectra) of the light and dark green solids of C1 (\u03b1-C1\u00b72thf and \u03b2-C1\u00b72.5thf) can be attributed to a change in the coordination mode of the ligand to the CuII centre. While the coordination sphere and orientation of the donor atoms in C3 and C4 are similar and the axial Cu\u2013N and Cu\u2013O distances identical, their equatorial bond lengths [Cu(1)\u2013Neq] differ significantly. Compound C4 was found to have a more uniform distribution of Cu(1)\u2013Neq bond lengths [2.166(3)\u20132.232(3) \u00c5] than C3 [2.077(3)\u20132.352(3) \u00c5], one Cu\u2013Neq distance being unusually long, when compared with similar bonds in a range of copper(II) complexes of tren derivatives.",

    "abstract": " Computer modeling techniques using well-tested potential models to describe the interatomic interactions have been used to study the surface carbonation of the low index surfaces of magnesium and calcium oxides. We begin by studying the {100} surface and related, stepped {310} surface of these model oxides. Our results indicate that carbonation is indeed a favorable process, particularly enhanced by the inclusion of the step on the surface, and proceeds via incorporation into the surface, rather than mono- or bidentate adsorption above the surface. As the amount of surface carbonation is increased, surface energy lowers to a minimum, with calculated vibrational frequencies indicating the formation of a layer of carbonate material. In comparison to water adsorption, the majority of calcium oxide surfaces are predicted to compete favorably, whereas the magnesium equivalents show a greater stability from water. This is particularly apparent for the higher energy, polar {111} surface which forms a very stable hydroxylated surface.",

    "abstract": "This study details density functional theory calculations on all the polymorphs of the binary oxides of antimony (Sb2O3, Sb2O4, and Sb2O5) to assess the electronic structures and differences in bonding between SbIII and SbV ions with oxygen. The results show that lone-pair formation is via a similar mechanism to other main group elements which exhibit an oxidation state of two less than the group valence, through direct interaction of Sb 5s and O 2p states, with the antibonding interaction stabilized by Sb 5p states. Furthermore, structural distortion of the Sb site directly affects the strength of the resulting lone pair. In addition to the analysis of the density of states and charge density, band structures and optical absorption spectra are also detailed. The results indicate that all materials are indirect band gap materials, with the exception of the \u03b2-polymorphs of Sb2O3 and Sb2O4. In addition, the fundamental and optical band gaps of the materials are found to decrease from Sb2O3 to Sb2O4 to Sb2O5. Calculated band-edge effective masses suggest that \u03b2-Sb2O3 may exhibit reasonable p-type properties. Furthermore, \u03b2-Sb2O3, \u03b3-Sb2O3, and Sb2O5 possess low electron effective masses which are conducive with strong n-type conduction.",

Acids and esters have been used in coupling reactions with amines, but aldehydes and alcohols have also been used in oxidative couplings. The use of nitriles and oximes as starting materials for amide formation are also emerging areas of interest. The use of carbon monoxide in the transition metal catalysed coupling of amines has led to a powerful methodology for amide bond formation and this is complemented by the addition of an aryl or alkenyl group to an amide typically using palladium or copper catalysts.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ",

    "abstract": "We report atom-level simulations of the surface selectivity and the resulting surface phase diagrams for the {100}, {110}, {111}, and {310} surfaces of CaO and MgO as a function of varying CO2 and H2O partial pressures. This work extends the traditional approach based on ab initio calculations, which can be time-consuming and costly for large systems, by using semiempirical atomistic simulations. The advantage of this approach is that very large numbers of calculations can be performed, thereby allowing a more effective search of the configurational space. The resulting free energies are used to generate the surface phase diagrams. The results indicate that the {100} surfaces of MgO and CaO show different dominant phases at atmospheric concentrations of gaseous water and carbon dioxide. The CaO surface forms a carbonated phase, whereas the MgO surface contains associatively adsorbed water. On the other hand, both {111} surfaces show the dominance of surface hydroxylation, effectively forming a layer of mineral hydroxide, with carbonation only observed at very high carbon dioxide concentrations. Finally, the {310} surfaces show enhanced reactivity with carbonate, most likely a result of the steps on the surfaces. In general, we predict that the minimum CO2 partial pressure needed to carbonate these surfaces can be controlled by the water partial pressure. The effect of temperature is also considered, and the results show how the number of surface adsorbates decreases as temperature increases.",

    "abstract": " The 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17\u03b2-HSDs) catalyze the interconversion between the oxidized and reduced forms of androgens and estrogens at the 17 position. The 17\u03b2-HSD type 1 enzyme (17\u03b2-HSD1) catalyzes the reduction of estrone to estradiol and is expressed in malignant breast cells. Inhibitors of this enzyme thus have potential as treatments for hormone dependent breast cancer. Here we report the syntheses and biological evaluation of novel inhibitors based on the estrone or estradiol template. These have been investigated by modification at the 6, 16 or 17 positions or combinations of these in order to gain information about structure\u2212activity relationships by probing different areas in the enzyme active site. Activity data have been incorporated into a QSAR with predictive power, and the X-ray crystal structures of compounds 15 and 16c have been determined. Compound 15 has an IC50 of 320 nM for 17\u03b2-HSD1 and is selective for 17\u03b2-HSD1 over 17\u03b2-HSD2. Three libraries of amides are also reported that led to the identification of inhibitors 19e and 20a, which have IC50 values of 510 and 380 nM respectively, and 20h which, having an IC50 value of 37 nM, is the most potent inhibitor of 17\u03b2-HSD1 reported to date. These amides are also selective for 17\u03b2-HSD1 over 17\u03b2-HSD2.  ",

    "abstract": "Tin monoxide is a technologically important p-type material which has a layered structure dictated by nonbonded dispersion forces. As standard density functional theory (DFT) approaches are unable to account for dispersion forces properly, they routinely give rise to a poor description of the unit cell structure. This study therefore applies two forms of empirical dispersion corrections, using either atomic- or ionic-based parameters for the dispersion coefficients, to assess their ability to correctly model the atomic structure and the formation energies of the important p-type defects. Although both approaches show an improvement in the predicted unit cell structure over that with no dispersion corrections, the ionic-based parameter set shows significantly better results, with lattice vectors reproduced within 0.2% of experiment. The atomic-based parameters still predict a distorted cell though, which is carried through to the defective system. On the introduction of defects, a similar degree of structural relaxation is observed regardless of the approach. The defect formation energies, however, are seen to differ more substantially, with the atomic-based set giving an overestimation of the energies due to excessive Sn\u2013Sn interactions. Overall, this study shows that empirical van der Waals corrections utilizing an ionic-based parameter set can be used to model SnO.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we have reported that nanoporous gold (NPG) films prepared by a chemical dealloying method have distinctive plasmonic properties, i.e., they can simultaneously support localized and propagating surface plasmon resonance modes (l-SPR and p-SPR, respectively). In this study, the plasmonic properties of NPG are quantified through direct comparison with thermally evaporated gold (EG) films. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments reveal that the NPG films have 4\u20138.5 times more accessible surface area than EG films. Assemblies of streptavidin\u2013latex beads generate p-SPR responses on both NPG and EG films that correlate well with the bead density obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. A layer-by-layer assembly experiment on NPG involving biotinylated anti-avidin IgG and avidin, studied by l-SPR and SEM, shows that the l-SPR signal is directly linked to the accessibility of the interior of the NPG porosity, an adjustable experimental parameter that can be set by the dealloying condition and time.",

Annealing at 500 \u00b0C in air improves photocurrents most likely due to improved interparticle charge transport (e.g., removal of hydration or n-hexanol surface layers). In phototransients (interpreted here in the limiting case of a weakly associated nanoparticle aggregate as opposed to the limiting case of a single-crystal semiconductor), evidence for the presence of both holes (as O(-I), fast moving) and electrons (as W(V), slow moving) is obtained in particular in as-deposited films. Bipotentiostat experiments reveal the presence of chlorine as a reaction intermediate close to the photoanode when immersed in 3 M NaCl. A \u201cmolecular conduit\u201d effect with adsorbed Co(II/III) sepulchrate is observed to significantly enhance the photocurrents at as-deposited electrodes (but not at annealed electrodes).",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe removal of nitroaromatics from polluted water is difficult due to their high stability to conventional treatment methods. This paper presents a method for the destruction of 1,3-dinitrobenzene and 2,4-dinitrotoluene in aqueous solutions. The compounds are shown to be stable to reaction with ozone, even under ultrasonic activation. The use of ultrasound enhances the rate of electrochemical reduction but the overall rate of reaction is still slow. However, the simultaneous application of ultrasound and ozonation to the electrochemical reaction allows virtually complete destruction of the compounds in short times. The effect is attributed to the ultrasonic enhancement of the electrochemical process giving intermediates that are susceptible to ozone oxidation. While further analytical work is needed to deduce the exact contributions of the various possible degradation mechanisms, the work demonstrates the synergies that can be gained by using combined techniques for the destruction of these difficult compounds.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCommercial nano-CIGSe powder (nominal CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2, average particle size\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0nm) is applied to tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrodes in a simple \u201croll-on\u201d process from n-hexanol to give thin photo-electrochemically active films. Films \u201cas deposited\u201d and \u201cannealed\u201d in selenium atmosphere at 350\u00a0\u00b0C are compared with the latter performing substantially better. Perhaps surprisingly, photo-transient voltammetry suggests only insignificant effects when changing aqueous electrolyte from Eu(NO3)3 to KNO3 or when changing electrolyte concentration, most likely due to a dominating electron-quenching process caused by dissolved dioxygen. However, when under inert argon atmosphere, generator-collector photo-transient voltammetry with a 50\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm Pt collector microelectrode placed close to the CIGSe film surface proves photo-induced H2 formation in 0.1\u00a0M KNO3 or in 0.1\u00a0M HNO3 (and it confirms electron-quenching by O2 in the presence of air). In aqueous 0.1\u00a0M HNO3 effective electron-quenching (photo-hydrogenation) with fumaric acid is observed with current yields of ca. 60% for fumarate to succinate conversion. Detrimental loss of photoelectrochemical activity (probably via photo-corrosion) with time occurs.",

    "abstract": "A theoretical model is presented for the formation of an ordered phase close to the air\u2212liquid interface of an open binary aqueous solution. The chemical potential of water in the liquid phase is, in general, not equal to the chemical potential of water in the ambient atmosphere. There are therefore nonequilibrium conditions close to the air\u2212liquid interface. There is also a gradient in the chemical potential of water, which could lead to the formation of a new interfacial phase. The formation of an interfacial phase is analyzed in terms of the equilibrium phase behavior corresponding to the local water chemical potential. The possibility of forming an interfacial phase is strongly dependent on the ambient conditions, bulk composition, and diffusive transport properties of the phases in question. Explicit calculations are presented for the formation of a lamellar liquid-crystalline phase close to the air\u2212liquid interface of an isotropic surfactant solution with parameters chosen from the sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT)/water system. We consider the relevance of the model to neutron reflectivity studies of the interface between air and surfactant/water systems, as well as to surfactant/polymer/water systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe describe several novel morphological features in the nasal region of the hammerhead shark Sphyrna tudes. Unlike the open, rounded incurrent nostril of non-hammerhead shark species, the incurrent nostril of S. tudes is a thin keyhole-like aperture. We discovered a groove running anterior and parallel to the incurrent nostril. This groove, dubbed the minor nasal groove to distinguish it from the larger, previously described, (major) nasal groove, is common to all eight hammerhead species. Using life-sized plastic models generated at 200\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcm resolution from an X-ray scan, we also investigated flow in the nasal region. Even modest oncoming flow speeds stimulate extensive, but not complete, circulation within the model olfactory chamber, with flow passing through the two main olfactory channels. Flow crossed from one channel to another via a gap in the olfactory array, sometimes guided by the interlamellar channels. Major and minor nasal grooves, as well as directing flow into the olfactory chamber, can, in conjunction with the nasal bridge separating incurrent and excurrent nostrils, limit flow passing into the olfactory chamber, possibly to protect the delicate nasal structures. This is the first simulation of internal flow within the olfactory chamber of a shark.",

Conventional structural analysis using the Rietveld method reveals the oxide ions to be distributed over three crystallographic sites at room temperature, with a small change in this distribution at 800 \u00b0C. Analysis of short-range correlations using a total neutron scattering approach yields information on Bi and Y coordination environments. Careful analysis of the angular distribution functions derived from reverse Monte Carlo modeling of the total scattering data reveals physical evidence for a predominance of \u27e8110\u27e9 vacancy ordering in this system.
