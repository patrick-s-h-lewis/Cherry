      "********************\n",
      "This study shows that DNA (linearized plasmid, 4331 base pairs and salmon sperm, 2000 base pairs, respectively) adsorbs to model membranes of zwitterionic liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers in solutions containing divalent Ca2+ cations, and also in solutions containing monovalent Na+. The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles. In the presence of Ca2+, DNA induces the formation of multilamellar vesicles in which DNA intercalates the lamellae. Possible electrostatic and hydrophobic mechanisms for the adsorption of DNA in solutions containing monovalent salt are discussed and compared to the observations in divalent salt.\n",

      "********************\n",
      "Ionic transport in conventional ionic solids is generally considered to proceed via independent diffusion events or ``hops.'' This assumption leads to well-known Arrhenius expressions for transport coefficients, and is equivalent to assuming diffusion is a Poisson process. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the low-temperature $B1$, $B3$, and $B4$ AgI polymorphs, we have compared rates of ion hopping with corresponding Poisson distributions to test the assumption of independent hopping in these common structure types. In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed. In low temperature $B3$ and $B4$, diffusion is characterized by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops. Diffusion coefficients cannot be expressed in a simple Arrhenius form dependent on single-ion free energies, and intrinsic diffusion must be considered a many-body process.\n",

Oxidation and reduction of quinizarin are observed as three-phase boundary processes at the immiscible oil | water | carbon interface. Randomly packed glassy carbon microspheres (2–12 µm diameter) held together with a polystyrene binder (ca. 0.1 % by weight) are immobilized onto a pencil lead electrode and used for electrochemical oil analysis. Pore-filling with oil is optimised for voltammetric detection and fluorescence spectroscopy is employed to support the mechanistic analysis based on voltammetry. Future applications for a wider range of oils and additives are proposed.\n",

      "This study shows that DNA (linearized plasmid, 4331 base pairs and salmon sperm, 2000 base pairs, respectively) adsorbs to model membranes of zwitterionic liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers in solutions containing divalent Ca2+ cations, and also in solutions containing monovalent Na+. The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles. In the presence of Ca2+, DNA induces the formation of multilamellar vesicles in which DNA intercalates the lamellae. Possible electrostatic and hydrophobic mechanisms for the adsorption of DNA in solutions containing monovalent salt are discussed and compared to the observations in divalent salt.\n",

Without resorting to higher carbonisation temperatures, substantial improvements in both electrical conductivity and electron transfer reactivity are observed after “surface-graphenisation”, that is coating with graphene-oxide prior to vacuum carbonisation. Improvements in voltammetric characteristics are demonstrated for both membranes mounted on ITO substrates and free-standing membranes suspended over the end of a borosilicate glass capillaries for (i) the aqueous phase hydroquinone/benzoquinone redox system and (ii) the biphasic oil|aqueous ion transfer redox system tetraphenylporphyrinato-Mn(III/II) in 4-phenyl-(3-propyl)-pyridine).\n",

      "********************\n",
      "The free radical 4-benzoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4B-TEMPO) is active as an electrocatalyst for primary alcohol oxidations when immobilised at an electrode surface and immersed into an aqueous carbonate buffer solution. In order to improve the catalytic process, a composite film electrode is developed based on (i) carbon microparticles of 2–12 μm diameter to enhance charge transport and (ii) a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (here PIM-EA-TB with a BET surface area of 1027 m2 g−1). The latter acts as a highly rigid molecular framework for the embedded free radical catalyst with simultaneous access to aqueous phase and substrate. The resulting mechanism for the oxidation of primary alcohols is shown to switch in reaction order from first to zeroth with increasing substrate concentration consistent with a kinetically limited process with competing diffusion of charge at the polymer layer-electrode interface (here the “LEk” case in Albery-Hillman notation). Reactivity optimisation and screening for a wider range of primary alcohols in conjunction with DFT-based relative reactivity correlation reveals substrate hydrophobicity as an important factor for enhancing catalytic currents. The PIM-EA-TB host matrix is proposed to control substrate partitioning and thereby catalyst reactivity and selectivity.\n",

For two of the Pd(II) complexes and the Ni(II) complex the crystal structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. A further insight into the geometry and electronic structure of [PdBr2{(2,6-Me2C6H3)NC(Cl)}2] was gained using density functional theoretical calculations (DFT). This compound resembles structurally and electronically typical olefin polymerisation pre-catalysts supported by Î±-diimines incorporating methyl- and 1,8-naphtalenyl substituents at the ligand backbone. The chlorine-substituted backbone of the free ligand [2,6-Me2C6H3NC(Cl)]2 can be employed in further alkylation reactions to generate new multifunctional ligand prototypes with potential uses as ansa-metallocene/diimines building blocks for catalytic applications of heterobimetallic complexes.\n",

      "The hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally above 353 K and utilizes an unusual promiscuous nonphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway to metabolize both glucose and galactose. It has been proposed that a part-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway occurs in parallel in S. solfataricus, in which the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (KDGK) is promiscuous for both glucose and galactose metabolism. Recombinant S. solfataricus KDGK protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallized in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.1 and 1.4 M NaCl. The crystal structure of apo S. solfataricus KDGK was solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.0 Å and a ternary complex with 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDGlu) and an ATP analogue was resolved at 2.1 Å. The complex suggests that the structural basis for the enzyme's ability to phosphorylate KDGlu and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal) is derived from a subtle repositioning of residues that are conserved in homologous nonpromiscuous kinases.\n",
